1c28s17,"guys do not lose hope. ignore 400 paar, i do not think bjp's win is that easy. first of all we need a wake up call from this media/social media narrative. these narratives are in bjp's control since media is with them and they have significant it cell backing. bjp had 303 seats in 2019 lok sabha seats. to get to their target they have to retain all these seats and gain 67. which is quite difficult even impossible. don't believe the media's narrative. 1) unemployment is a big issue. not everyone is going to vote for it - yes. some people might even ignore it but people who are facing these issues themselves, their family is not going to vote for them. it'll reduce their vote share. 2) farmers have been hurling stones at the bjp party. they have no credibility left with farmers. not all farmers but a major percentage. their families will not be voting for bjp in this elections (and some people just never). haryana and punjab being important states. 3) 2019 had a significant increase from 2014 seats because of jio's free internet, pulwama attack etc. today, it's about mandir which has faded a little bit already. 4) bjp's image is not as clean as 2019. there were no big issues raised. today their image has fallen. they are desperate. today people are saying they are less corrupted. 5) democracy dying is a big narrative that is there. some people may dismiss it but they know it already. 6) alliance also mean that oppositions vote share will be one. they are more likely to gain the number of vote share fighting as one. 7) nitish kumar's image in bihar has fallen down. people have started hating him a little. bjp is much likely to lose seats there. 8) karnataka where they performed really well but recently lost in state elections, are they going to perform and retian the same number of seats - 25/28? 9) covid second wave being one of the biggest failures of the government. has it not lost some amount of credibility there? all i'm saying is let's not get sucked into the narrative that it's definitely a win. we should be okay with being wrong rather than just giving up. it's time we spread the counter-narrative through our social media accounts and start questioning the narrative. let's call bullshit on bjp. their fake promises of growth and how corrupted they are. there are around 900 million voters. if you meet one person one second from this point on then it'll take you 28 years to meet everyone. so no survey, no opinion can tell you the truth. so don't give up hope. 400 paar means petol/ disel - 400 paar 400 paar is a blatant falsehood, it's being done to attract fence-sitters. they have no issue-driven narrative this year, which is why pm is playing ram mandir and veg-non veg politics and meeting up with gamers. but on the ground, the issues of unemployment, price rise, and even paper leak are going to hurt them. even in 2019, we heard about zero corruption and ""thriving"" economy from bjp leaders during campaigns. all that is completely absent this time. they are relying too much on religion, which i think isn't going to work. so let's not lose hope. even as supporter of bjp i don't want them to have 400 seats hopefully they get somthing like 250-270 just under majority this government needs to get a ego check a strong opposition is good for everyone reddit communities are completely ignorant about the rural voters which are close to 65% of the total population. the 35% urban voters comprise of a lot of migrants from other states or rural india. most of them won’t be able to vote as they will get only one day holiday from their mnc’s. the rural voters on the other hand are inspired by whatsapp groups where bjp is absolutely dominating. free jio was a masterstroke from ambani & modi to get rural india hooked to the internet and control them. since im on wfh from my native, i rarely see any reach from india (offline or online) the only hope for india is their 1lpa to the poor. they won karnataka with a similar strategy, hope it works out at the national level as well. bjp is sucking it's own dick with their 400 paar narrative. it's not gonna happen and i am sure even the higher ups know it. they are saying it to discourage the opposition as well as to bolster their cadres. but going by the on-ground reality, nda will surely make government, just the numbers will be closer to 2014 results.","A user urges voters to ignore the BJP's '400 paar' slogan, arguing it is a psychological tactic to discourage opposition.

19dg088,"to the pm of this country - a question. over many centuries across the world, thousands of religious monuments must have been destroyed only for something else to be erected in it’s place - typically a structure belonging to the religion of the person / group of people involved in its destruction. however, these were different times. these were times when religion held great sway over people - right down from their lifestyle to what they ate to where they lived to their importance in society - everything was dictated by religion. these were not modern times, these were not civilised societies. but this is now. this is 2024. does religion still control everything? are our lives and our standing in society supposed to be governed entirely by religion? if not, then why is the prime minister of a nation so intent in trying to settle scores with a historical ruler from 500 years ago? as pm, is he not responsible for the entire country and all citizens since the time of it being handed over to you? even if babur destroyed a hindu temple to build a mosque - that mosque too has existed for over 500 years now. was it not part of india? histories of countries are messy, complicated affairs. but that does not mean you start undoing every little thing that displeases you today about your past. will you start destroying every mosque that has ever been built on once disputed territory? the mughals were not plunderers and looters like timur and so many others - who took what they needed and left india. the mughals lived and ruled this land for over 350 years! they played a great role in uniting large parts of south asia into what we call india today. trying to undo their influence, ‘righting their wrongs’ as you see it - is actually trying to undo the very history of india. for arguments sake, if someone starts a rumour or if you find some kind of archaeological evidence of the taj mahal being built over the ruins of a previous hindu structure - will you bring it down too? i'm a muslim and i'll reply to this: 1.) there is evidence that there was some pre-islamic structure with ornate architecture underneath the mosque. temple or not, there was some structure that was presumably demolished with shaivite carvings. 2.) the mughals may have spent 350 years in india, but that's only because they had no choice. babur was first kicked out of the ferghana valley, then kicked out of kandahar and herat, and then the entirety of khorasan (after shah ismail i safavid took over his former domains from the uzbek shaybanids). he really had no option - either get into conflict with the uzbek khanate, or persia, or move east to india. 3.) babur spent most of his time in kabul. reading baburnama, it was clear that he despised india and indians in general, calling us dirty, disobedient and unwilling to pay taxes. kabul was home for him. 4.) most of the mughals, save for akbar and maybe jahangir, did not have much of a deep connection with india - unlike the previous folks from other indian sultanates before the mughals. babur and humayun mostly spoke chagatai, while the rest spoke mostly persian, even though hindi was prominent. 5.) ayodhya is not a significant location for us. it isn't even a tomb of anyone prominent, unlike say the shah abbas shrine in karbala. but it's the equivalent of jerusalem for hinduism. desecration may not have been warranted though, relocating the historical mosque to another location would have been more fruitful. of course, such higher order thinking never passed through the heads of bjp or congress. 6.) the building of the temple now just fortifies the victim mentality of the muslim community. boohoo, the mosque got demolished - but what about the fact that mughals and sultans specifically chose to build mosques on the religious sites of other religions, as a mark of affrontery to them? we already see this in jerusalem, where the dome of the rock was specifically built on the site of the jewish temple. parsi temples all over persia and azerbaijan were converted to mosques en masse, and only now are being converted back into fire temples. why do people fail to understand that it was no ordinary temple? it's literally the birthplace of lord ram. would you say the same thing if bethlehem, jerusalem, mecca or medina?? people need to understand that ayodhya is very revered for hindus. even i'm not a religious person but i can understand why hindus want temple in this city or mathura. you guys conveniently ignore the sentiments of hindus and spin it all the way to ""is it necessary"". of course it's necessary. it's as much necessary as mosque in kaba or church in bethlehem. “the mughals were not plunderers and looters……….” they were not civilised and it was not a civilised society either. they discriminated based on religion which ultimately proved that it was not a civilised society. correction ! the fact that shree ram was born in ayodhya has been a part of the hindu belief system long before any major religions existed on this earth. it is not a rumor. and modi didn’t bring down babari masjid. it was demolished in the last century, the demolition is now a part of indias history too. so get over it. temple could’ve been built a long time ago but there was a civil court case, which is the standard of procedure and the decision of supreme court is final in india. edit: grammar, generalization lol people elected him because he promised to build that temple. so of course religion is a very big part of our nation and our ways of life…","Critique of the focus on settling historical religious grievances versus addressing modern governance needs, with detailed historical debate on the Mughal era and Ayodhya.","['Questioning focus on 500-year-old historical conflicts', 'Debate on Mughal history and connection to India', 'Ayodhya compared to Jerusalem for Hinduism', ""Users argue modern society shouldn't be governed by ancient scores""]",Identity & Religion

voters can hold governments accountable for their actions, potentially leading to complacency among elected representatives >>>*1. when elections are staggered and spread across, it atleast keeps the

registry, and then after breakup >>2. **anti-woman and anti-democratic (anti-liberty and state interference in personal lives):** the ucc is seen as anti-woman, anti-democratic, and draconian. it restricts adult women's sexual autonomy, allows for moral policing, and interferes in consensual relationships, including marriage and divorce >3.**criminalization and penalties**: the ucc is criticized for its heavy focus on penalties and punishment, creating a legal environment that criminalizes personal choices and relationships. >4 **exclusion of tribes and targeting minorities**: critics highlight the exclusion of scheduled tribes (sts) from the ucc and its perceived targeting of muslims. the law is viewed as a ""hindu code"" that imposes cultural values on all citizens, especially minorities > 5.**registration of live-in relationships**: mandatory registration of live-in relationships is seen as intrusive, violating individual autonomy, and potentially leading to marital disputes, interference from authorities, and societal scrutiny >6. **selective application and double standards:** critics argue that the ucc's selective application, exemptions for certain communities, and exclusion of tribal and minority groups undermine the law's claim to uniformity and equality >7. these criticisms collectively paint a picture of a ucc in uttarakhand that is perceived as regressive, discriminatory, and detrimental to personal freedoms, especially in the context of relationships and breakups. **and then if bjp wins this time with almost similar results as

nominations, forcing them to withdraw and win uncontested without even a single vote being cast like it happened in indore,surat and in arunachal pradesh, 10 bjp mlas have been declared elected unopposed (they have simultaneous assembly and lok sabha elections) 19. i also have a distant fear that once nrc is brought in and implemented, muslims might be particularly at the receiving end and a significant number of them might be declared as infiltrators. i dont know why i feel this , but i feel this more so after pm gave a blatant hate speech saying muslims are those who have more kids and are infiltrators… 20. delimitation if not done properly will make the south politically irrelevant because up + bihar will have equal political influence of that of the entire south. 21. add above delimitation and the way they undermine rajya sabha by bypassing bills by introducing them as money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, further reduces the states political power in the federal structure. the list is endless and these are some of the major things that come to my mind and are certainly gloomy. i seriously don’t have energy to fight the whataboutery and falsehoods spread about the india alliance.. remember in india politics is not who is good and better than the other but rather who is the lesser evil…and it’s clear who the lesser evil is. amazing how people are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure. its highly likely that bjp will return to power for 3rd term on their own. as much as i don’t want bjp to return , i’m starting to lose hope and i’m starting to believe in what bhakts say , “ayega toh modi hi” , so be mentally prepared (atleast i am)… good luck and best wishes to all of us. you forgot to add independence of the judiciary. not only will one election determine who rules all states, it will also determine who appoints judges. so, forget about the government having independent branches and checks and balances. too much power concentrated in the hands of supreme leader. what if in the far future the supreme leader is not modi but monu manesar? brilliant op. appreciate the effort. just how easily we got used to bills not passing in parliament through robust debate and the pm it doing press conferences or answering questions is what scares me the most. i am worried about delimitation. if that shit goes through then north and central india will have more influence on politics and we all know who has the higher ground in the region. this space has become way too leftist. there is nothing wrong in putting those points there but i have read few comments stating posts\comments related to right wing being removed and people getting banned. that’s not democracy either. coming back to the post, yes, very well written, we can’t ignore many of those points out there. i hope someone would write a long list of points for the opposition parties too. no one’s a saint here and people know it. i hope everyone votes wisely. you forgot about delimitation, broadcast regulation bill and elimination of obc reservations.","Detailed user concerns regarding

1d9d4hb,"[urgent] massive irregularities uncovered in neet exam – please help us! neet, the only exam for medical school admissions in india, is currently embroiled in a controversy due to significant irregularities detected this year. we want to raise awareness. 1.score discrepancies: the cutoff has been following a steady trend for the last few years. an increase of cutoff by 10-20 marks is expected, and we were all expecting a rank jump of few thousands. however, this year a jump by 50 marks in the cutoff has been observed. people getting 650 out of 720 will not get a seat, with a rank of 40k! last year it was 6k rank at the same marks! inflation of over 6 times. this abnormality demands immediate attention and investigation. 2. unusual perfect scores: 6-12 students from a single exam centre in haryana achieved perfect scores of 720/720. the probability of that is so small it nears impossible! 3. spike in perfect scores: unlike previous years, where only a 2/3 max achieved a perfect score, this year saw an alarming surge, with 67 students attaining the highest possible marks. 4. ranking anomalies: anomalies in ranking, such as a student with a perfect score of 720 obtaining an air of 1.54. 5. grace marks: numerous students have reported scores of 718/719 in the neet exam, which contradicts neet's scoring system. the nta attributes these anomalies to ""grace marks"" and ""normalization,"". in recent statements they have even said it is to combat coaching mafia influence, which makes no sense and raises suspicions of a cover-up. the criteria, basis, and extent of these adjustments remain unclear. 6. paper leak allegations: the neet exam has been marred by allegations of paper leaks, with the recent patna case revealing a definite leak. this raises serious concerns about the integrity of the exam process and demands a thorough investigation. 7. suspicious timing: the release of the results 10 days earlier than expected (june 14), suspiciously coinciding with the indian election results, has raised eyebrows, especially considering nta's history of not releasing results so soon. they know the media houses and general population will be preoccupied. the supreme court, too is out of session and will not resume until july 7th. by that time counselling would have started. if they had released the result on 14th there would still be a chance of cases to be heard. please help us. tens of thousands of lives of students are at stake. please raise awareness. if any of you are lawyers/activists or have experience in such cases tell us what we can do. please bring to the attention of journalists. nta has time and time shown itself to be an organisation that does not care about the students, and one we cannot trust. the pleas of students are never heard. similar incidents happened in jee main this year yet all they did is deny. please please don’t let this get swept up under the rug too. won't even get a college at this marks. spread the word. please. 2 people have already killed themselves in less than 48 hours. there'll be more coming fuck nta all my homies hate nta r/india please support us cfbr doesn't work, only upvoting works on reddit. this is very bad. all the media are now concentrating on the election right now. this needs to be discussed much more. this is affecting 2.5 million students.","Urgent allegations of massive irregularities in the 2024 NEET exam surface, citing statistically improbable cutoff inflation, a surge in perfect scores from a single center, and controversial 'grace marks'.

1e2zuyl,"guidelines to deal with andh-bhakts (roadmap till 2029 general election) for past decade, specially for last 5 years most of us are fighting ideological battles on different level. due to the radicalization in politics, opinion are getting divided on every factor of life. but most will agree that fighting larger battle with system is easier than dealing with your dear ones who are now brainwashed and have became andh-bhakts (or it can be that these people were always like this but now they have just become vocal due to the toxic environment which accepts this behaviour). this years lok sabha election was clear indication that major population is not brainwashed, infact these andh-bhakts vote banks are in minority (the irony) and if we keep pushing like this then this radicalization will keep decreasing till next election. but this fight is causing too much damage to relations, with my personal experience of fighting ideological battle i would like to share guidelines with all who would like to continue this fight, but don't want to damage relationship with closed ones. guidlines - 1. first and foremost do not call an individual directly andh-bhakt (even if they are one). because ones you insult them on personal level then they will always deny and ignore your opinion. so we should keep using andh-bhakts term but not on their face but to call out a group or type of people. 2. be ready with facts - whenever political discussion start first thing they do is to praise their supreme leader. be ready with proof facts and blunders made by the current government so you can counter them. 3. do not argue, instead ask questions! so while debating on these topics start asking questions instead of arguing with them. there is reason why they are called andh-bhakts they don't have any concrete facts or studies their only source of knowledge are godi media propoganda, whatsapp university and cheap instagram/youtube reels. so when you start asking valid questions they will get uncomfortable. 4. listen to their praises for supremo - do listen to their reason of why they support current government. once you listen carefully two things will happen, they will trust you and listen to you as well and second thing is you can find false information in their reason and can use to counter it and correct them on the spot. 5. make collection of facts - use instagram, youtube etc and save or bookmark reels and articles. so you will have ready ammunition to throw at them right away. catching them by surprise. 6. instead of wasting energy to correct individual focus on spreading awareness and positivity - if you keep fighting one person to change their mindset it will never happen. humans are stubborn (just look at you. hoe you are fighting whole world!), so instead be firm on your opinion and keep spreading awareness. love and positivity will always prevail over hate and negativity. 7. do criticize opposition as well - we call them andh-bhakts because they blindly support only one side. so we also don't want to do that, so we should also criticise to everyone who is in wrong. be it opposition, international 3rd party or minority. this will increase our credibility. 8. praise government as well! yes you heard it right! don't just keep criticising government, if something is done right by current government then don't hesitate to praise them, again this will add some credibility. 9. don't ever say that only after 2014 we are in bad phase - instead talk about how we need to raise voice against any government if they are wrong. be firm on belief that government works for us, not vice versa. 10. do not break friendship or good relations over political opinions - the thing is government will come and go, but people around you, your friends, family, colleagues they are the one who are with you for lifetime. they are the one who will help you in your need. so discuss with them but don't get angry or frustrated be more understanding. you already know you have better reasoning mind than them so be grateful and be patient, don't lose your loved ones over shitty phase of our country. also, in my experience i have learned that most of andh-bhakts even when they know that their paw-paw is wrong still they don't accept it, reason being their pride! we as human hate to be proven wrong, so they are ready to die on fighting that hill. so understand this and instead of defeating them win them slowly and steadily. after all love, hope and forgiveness are one of the strongest emotions of our world. so we should always abide by them. 4th june 2023 was very unexpected day, even in such hopeless situation we saw power of democracy showing its place to a tyrannical regime, so next 5 years are more hopeful. change don't happen over night, it will happen slowly and steadily. if we don't lose our hope and abide by our ethics we just might win and get rid of this hate-ridden atmosphere in our country! p.s. - i would like if you all also can add more points to this list. also, do share experiences about your ideological battles! andbhakti isn't just bjp thing, it is in our society it exists for sports man, baba log , actors. in politics it isn't just in bjp, it is in most party, just that bjp had too many mouthpiece and budget so it was very loud from tv to social media and they were really great in propaganda. now inc is catching up in this game, bjp andhbhakts are mostly silent on social media these days because of fatigue, but there is rapid increase in andhbhakti of inc. people need to be reasonable and rational about the things, and shouldn't trust the person blindly. it is very bad for society. echochambers are also one of the major reasons for such andhbhakti. so, try to be aware about social media biases. i just ignore them and dint respond to any political messages. man you couldn't have put it better. inc andhbhakti now definitely on the rise. you can see it in a few posts with people calling rahul the man of the people. like huh?!?! my reply to andhbhakts : i am not political. i don't care about politics. doesn't matter what monkey we elect, we are all doomed. i agree with what you saying but ""make a collection of facts - use instagram, youtube etc and save or bookmark reels and articles. so you will have ready ammunition to throw at them right away. catching them by surprise."" i think we should stop depending on social media as a primary source for understanding political party dynamics. instead, go actively engage in the political process by watching parliamentary proceedings, identifying party pledges, meeting with local mps to discuss their priorities/agendas, and researching policy reforms underway. relying on platforms like youtube and instagram for primary information is a recipe for disaster. that isn't to discredit online political activists but if you are looking up content on youtube and instagram or twitter for that matter, make sure you can substantiate it and not just because somebody said something.","A user proposes strategic guidelines for engaging with 'andh-bhakts' (blind supporters) to reduce political polarization by 2029.

1cvnucz,"the frenzy around the general elections makes no sense to me. every five years, we witness people get into a frenzy before and during any elections, especially if the election in question is a general election. for me personally, all of this frenzy makes no sense to me, whether it be the antics of bjp supporters or the antics of congress supporters. to me, both the bjp and the congress are merely the two sides of the same coin, if one understands that the interests of both parties are aligned with the interests of the oppressor caste capitalist and landlord ruling classes. i'd first like to address those who're supporting the bjp: under the garb of ""development"" and ""investment"", what y'all are really doing is nothing more than facilitating the loot and plunder of our country by the various imperialist powers of the world, specifically selling off our country and its rich resources to the tender mercies of us imperialism. and to prevent anyone from protesting against this loot and plunder, y'all aren't just happy with destroying the communal harmony of this country, you're also taking away the bare minimum of features that allows the indian state to at least pretend that it's ""democratic"". i'm not saying and i'm never gonna say that the congress or its supporters are better than you, because they are mere mirror reflections of you, but that the only difference between you two is that you guys managed to destroy our country in ten years that the congress took sixty years to do - which perhaps reflects an increase in the efficiency of screwing over this country and its people. the material conditions of our country has been bad, and y'all are more than happy to make it even worse, just so that the oppressor caste capitalist and landlord ruling classes that you guys are unwittingly serving get a higher profit margin. to those who're supporting the congress: all of the talk about the ""death of democracy"" that you guys engage in makes me laugh in both annoyance and incredulity. ""death of democracy""? this country has never been democratic in its ""independent"" history, and the congress has been the first party to destroy that façade of ""democracy"" that you and bjp supporters tuggle over in your rhetoric. in many cases, the congress themselves have been responsible for setting the stage for the bjp to come into power, where the socio-economic policies of the congress has not been any different from that of the bjp. all of the posturing that the congress has been doing are policies that the congress didn't even consider to carry out while they were in power, but now, they're talking about it solely because they wanna win a parliamentary majority against the bjp. such political opportunism sickens me, as much as the fascism of the bjp does. tldr: neither the congress nor the bjp is the answer. the only way to make to truly make our country into an actual sovereign, socialist and democratic republic is through a revolutionary movement aimed against feudalism and imperialism. otherwise, no amount of voting can change this situation. found a nota voter i completely understand and agree with you. but, realistically can this happen during this election? no, so please don't waste your vote and vote to bring down the bjp. the alternative might just be marginally better but nevertheless we need a short respite from the bjp's violent agenda to actually talk about the important things you are talking about. it's really really difficult to even have a conversation about privatization and unemployment and wealth inequality when the other person is shouting modi and jai shri ram like a war cry. show the bjp that this stuff isn't going to work anymore. let this anger and hatred fizzle down enough that people start realizing what government after government has done to them and then we can go for such things. the damage that the bjp has done is going to take decades to recover from and the first step must be to remove it from power. anything that hinders this, however good intentioned it may be is a crime against society at this point. please don't say anything that discourages people from voting right now! >i completely understand and agree with you. >but, realistically can this happen during this election? yes it can. we're already seeing a record low turn out in the number of people who're voting, and while they may have various reasons for not voting, it's pretty clear that the broad masses are losing faith in the electoral process. it's our job to raise the political and class consciousness of the masses to the point where they realise that they can't do shit by merely casting their vote. >no, so please don't waste your vote and vote to bring down the bjp. the alternative might just be marginally better but nevertheless we need a short respite from the bjp's violent agenda to actually talk about the important things you are talking about this is honestly a very bourgeois and liberal position to take. the ""alternative"" (there's honestly none, like i've tried to show in my post) is nothing more than controlled opposition, whose socio-economic policies aren't too different from that of the bjp. also, it's pure speculation on your part to assume that the congress would be ""marginally better"" or that they'd somehow give a ""short respite"" from the bjp, considering that past congress governments themselves had laid the groundwork for the ease with which the bjp got voted (or more aptly, installed) into power. please don't be under the illusion that the congress would ever heed to the important things i'm talking about, for the congress and the bjp serve the interests of the same oppressor caste capitalist and landlord ruling classes. >it's really really difficult to even have a conversation about privatization and unemployment and wealth inequality when the other person is shouting modi and jai shri ram like a war cry. the phenomenon of privatisation was commenced by the congress themselves, when they liberalised the economy back in 1991. as a result of this economic liberalisation and its consequent privatisation, unemployment and wealth inequality has been an inevitable outcome. the bjp just wishes to increase the degree to which this privatisation happens, which they seek to hide under the veil of communal politics. and there's no way in hell that the congress are gonna reverse the privatisation policy if they're installed back into power once again. >show the bjp that this stuff isn't going to work anymore. let this anger and hatred fizzle down enough that people start realizing what government after government has done to them and then we can go for such things. why just the bjp? the bjp, the congress and various other bourgeois political parties (including the so-called ""communists"" in parliament) have equally contributed to the situation that we're in right now. if we're not going to talk about the need for engaging in the boycott of elections and organising the working masses of our country to successfully complete the new democratic revolution right now, then when we're gonna talk about it, after the elections are over? if the congress wins, people will be under the erroneous illusion that we've somehow staved off fascism after the elections. it's important to talk about something that's important when it's relevant, strike when the iron is hot, as they'd say. >the damage that the bjp has done is going to take decades to recover from and the first step must be to remove it from power. anything that hinders this, however good intentioned it may be is a crime against society at this point. >please don't say anything that discourages people from voting right now! okay, this honestly makes me laugh. the damage that the bjp has done is the mere culmination of what the congress has been doing for the past sixty years. you can ""remove"" the bjp ""from power"", but that doesn't mean that the bjp is finished or the material conditions that sustains its politics has been somehow dealt a death blow. if you're at all worried about recovering from the damage that all of these bourgeois political parties have caused, then the first step towards that recovery is to organise the working masses of this country to seize political power for themselves, causing the revolutionary transformation of our country on scientific socialist lines. anything less than that is pretending at change while not doing anything to cause any fundamental changes. i will discourage people from voting, because revolution and the liberation of the working masses from their conditions of exploitation and oppression can't be brought about by voting. definitely this. only one thing tho, the bjp is more eager to open up the country to investment by foreign capitalists (the international imperialist bourgeoisie) in the name of ""development"". besides this single point, there's no practical difference between the two. marx could not have anticipated the material relations as they exist today, and certainly not in india where they're embedded within the framework of caste. elections are the only immediate way those of us who don't have the privilege of indulging in armchair pontificating can do to change their material conditions in the face of an immensely powerful capitalist complex.","A cynical perspective on the general elections argues that both BJP and Congress represent the same oppressor class interests, rendering voting futile.

1bqhtai,"elections 2024 i wanted to speak about current elections and am looking for advice too. i'm not a bjp voter. i've voted only once in my life in gujarat legislative elections for the congress party. but i'm also very anti left. kejriwal's arrest really scared me. bjp is openly going against the opposition. i was upset about sisodia and other people's arrest too. this is putin territory. but the congress has also taken a very left turn. their left language is scary and i worry about us going pre 91 days if they come to power. i've full confidence in leftist policies increasing poverty and misery as they've a very strong global track record of doing. also i'm concerned about the caste census and increasing reservations beyond what we have today which i think is something like 60 percent. i could never vote for the bjp. but i couldn't in good conscience vote for congress against the interests of my own family and also i think it's not in general interest either. but the bjp is going too far and jailing political opponents and that is unacceptable.i know one vote doesn't count for anything but i'm eager to listen to your opinions and maybe advice. kudos to you for thinking one party is better than the other. labour movement doesn't necessarily mean of the left. you can advocate for labour rights and welfare without being a socialist. so i don't believe all the people who made those good things happen were socialists. perhaps part of them were but i don't believe all were. and where did all these things happen ? in the capitalist west. labour rights in the soviet union or china or north korea are not that great. what it comes down to is that socialism is a top down system. a few people supposedly acting for the collective pass decrees that all must follow. it is a destroyer of human freedom and ingenuity. i often listen to socialist content. dr wolff on youtube. i've heard a lot about planning both pros and cons. i value human freedom a lot. and i've lost of problems with american style of politics. for example i'd have free healthcare and education(which is useful to society). but i'd never agree to destroying private ownership. i think that'd crush individual genius and enterprise. i won't comment about indian politics here but your comments about leftist policies is very interesting.. you are completely convinced by conservative right wing propaganda about what the leftists have done and you think that what happened in soviet russia is what leftist policies will do everywhere tell me if you disagree with all these things below which the leftists fought over in the past 100 to 200 years and won.. the 8-hour work day, 5 day work week, paid annual leave, employee benefits, worker safety regulations, minimum wage. in fact you should view the coverage by more perfect union on how netflix is exploiting reality tv show contestants for cheap labor and doesn't even make provisions to feed them and keep them healthy and wants them to be sleep deprived hungry and always drunk so that they can extract maximum drama for the tv show the channel majority report on youtube does amazing work covering leftist policies and they bring in export interviews to cover topics of labor unions and the economy and everything else basically you should check them out once i don't know why rahul gandhi is talking of increasing reservation when most dalits and tribals and their children work as bonded labourers and are landless farmers and their children don't have primary education and they don't get quality education as the government schools teachers do not attend and teach at school but draw their salary from their comfort of home. whether he increases or decreases, they don't care about it. they have been living in abject property and working in bricks kiln and some of them are rickshaw puller and tribals have sickle cells and they don't get quality education either as their teachers don't offer any better pedagogy to learn english speaking so they can easily comprehend, speaking and writing well. their black board teaching only promotes rote learning and memorization which doesn't augur well for their future prospect literally half of bjp used to be in congress. they’re all the same people at the end of the day. just that bjp does more religious politics and congress does more communal politics. none of them do development politics. the only thing is that if the bjp wins with more seats than last time, they have total power over everything. even over state governments. you’ll slowly see non bjp states start falling and eventually it’ll be just bjp everywhere. which is fine for those who vote for them but others should also feel included in a democracy.","A voter expresses a dilemma: being anti-BJP due to authoritarian trends ('Putin territory', jailing opponents) but also anti-Left/Congress due to economic fears and increasing reservations.

eci’s report on the enforcement of mcc on may 14, 2024, eci [~reported~]( on its two months of enforcement under mcc during elections 2024 (“mcc enforcement report”). while we appreciated the intent of transparency, critical gaps were observed in their response. firstly, eci acknowledged its pending decision on divisive statements made by the candidates “*on communal, caste, regional language divide, or on the sanctity of the constitution of india.*” an example of this was a [~post~]( by bjp’s karnataka unit on x (formerly twitter) which triggered nationwide outrage due to its communal attack on the inc. eci did not directly warn or take action against the bjp, and only directed the karnataka police to take down the controversial post after it had [~garnered~]( 9.2 million views and 13,000 reshares. despite wide [~coverage~]( of communal content being posted online by political actors during the election period for voter appeasement, eci failed to take notice of hate speeches being spread on the lines of caste, community, or religion at the right time. this is in spite of at least one national party filing a [~complaint~]( against the bjp to eci for the aforementioned post and other content posted by the party that too violates the mcc, representation of the people act, 1951, and the indian penal code, 1860. two weeks after this incident on x and a week after the release of the mcc enforcement report, eci finally issued a [~warning~]( on may 22, 2024 to the bjp and inc, asking the two political parties to desist from campaigning along caste, community, language, and communal lines. it asked bjp president jp nadda and inc chief mallikarjun kharge to issue formal notes to their star campaigners asking them to “*not make speeches and statements, which may divide the society*”, “*refrain from any campaigning methods/utterances along religious/communal lines*”, and “ *maintain decorum in their utterances*”. this deterrent action should have been taken as soon as such incidents were reported at the beginning of the elections, and not when five out of the seven phases of elections were done. eci’s delayed, inadequate and selective action in addressing crucial issues like this puts a serious dent on the electoral integrity and accountability of eci as an institution. additionally, the mcc enforcement report did not mention the terms ‘deepfakes’, ‘cheapfakes’, ‘false’, ‘misleading’, or ‘misinformation’ even once, and only once mentioned the term ‘morphed images’. this omission is surprising given the dominance of such manipulated/edited media in the general elections. regarding eci’s instruction to take down deepfake content within [~3 hours~]( it was unclear whether the parties were expected to [~identify~]( the content themselves or whether this responsibility falls on some other entity. throughout the election process, the parties had a responsibility under the premise of good faith to inform the voters that a particular manipulated/misleading media is being circulated and that the party does not officially associate with it, even if it benefits them disproportionately. this accountability was completely absent from the side of the political parties and their members. eci’s sparing response to the use of deepfakes and other forms of edited/distorted content which spreads disinformation has been delayed, dispiriting, and limited in scope. this impacted electoral integrity and the level of political discourse in the country amid a crucial democratic moment. the mcc enforcement report also highlighted the c-vigil app's robustness in reporting mcc violations during elections. however, shortly before the release of this report, citizens [~shared~]( their experience of being unable to [~upload~]( pre-recorded videos or link to social media content. for some users, the app did not work on either android or ios phones, preventing them from reporting violations occurring in the digital space. the other mechanism through which voters tried to complain to eci was over emails because the official channels did not work. but even this avenue failed. there was no way to ensure action or a follow-up when it came to email complaints. this highlights the eci’s inadequate grievance redressal system and the lack of a transparent mechanism to hold accountability over poll code violations. # free and fair seven phases. two months. 543 seats. over 96 crore voters. indian voters participated in the largest-ever election in the world to elect members of parliament to the 18th lok sabha. concurrently, elections have taken place for the legislative assemblies of andhra pradesh, arunachal pradesh, odisha, and sikkim and by-elections for 35 seats in 16 states. the stakes for our democracy have been higher than ever and we have been keeping our eyes on the ways in which technology is shaping the electoral process. we were also tracking all the absurd developments in the digital rights space during these elections. follow ‘[~digital rights are going great – elections edition~]( ]( stay updated on digital rights violations and visit our website [~freeandfair.in~]( to read about how iff responded to these violations.

18yzvyl,"let the die be cast: countering bjp's campaign ahead of the 2024 general election **वो सुब्ह हमीं से आएगी** **जब धरती करवट बदलेगी, जब क़ैद से क़ैदी छूटेंगे** **जब पाप घरौंदे फूटेंगे, जब ज़ुल्म के बंधन टूटेंगे** **उस सुब्ह को हम ही लाएँगे, वो सुब्ह हमीं से आएगी** bjp has unleashed a massive propaganda campaign ahead of the 2024 general election. this campaign can be summed up as two strategies. on one hand, they are trying to galvanize their supporters with the issue of ram mandir. on the other hand, they are trying to demoralize their opponents. bjp has gone into a hyperdrive to exploit the ram mandir for its political gains, which has become their single issue agenda this election. in the last 30 years, the party has fought every single election on the issue of ram mandir. when, advani began his rath yatra in 1991, which culminated in nationwide riots, bjp maintained that its only objective was the construction of ram mandir. after the 2019 ayodhaya judgement by the supreme court, its proponents claimed that this would lay this matter to a rest, and the nation can finally move forward to actual issues. yet, modi kept milking this agenda. when the nation was reeling under the covid lockdown, bjp devised a plan to distract the attention by organizing a grand stone-laying ceremony, and broadcasting the ramayana tv show. bjp also devised a clever scheme to keep their kettle boiling with the kashi-mathura agenda. this is despite the fact that both advani and vajpayee had publicly denied this agenda several times. in recent years, this agenda has led to a capture of our religious festivals by political mobs. hindutva organizations like bajrang dal have orchestrated violence during ram navami for political gains. a report by ashutosh varshney and bhanu joshi, reveals how this trend of violence during ram navami began from 1980s, when bjp began its strategy of using ram for capturing power. and now, with massive social, economic and political crisis unfolding in india, and the complete tyranny and incompetence of the administration writ large, bjp has fallen back into the feet of lord ram to retain its power. yet, this attempt at exploiting the religion and fooling the population is bound to fail. imam-e-hind will not bless these corrupt tyrants. the other part of bjp's electoral strategy is to demoralize and dissuade its opponents and critics. bjp has been viciously pushing the narrative of tina (there is no alternative) except modi. they are trying to declare the victory before the fight. bjp has clearly underestimated the strength of our resistance. 2024 general election is not an ordinary election. bjp has declared an assault against our republic. they have forcibly captured the parliament, and intend to turn the democracy into a fascist regime. they have imprisoned journalists, academicians, and activists. they have clamped down on our right to information, and created a regime of mass surveillance, and repression. i didn't have to look for the op's username i could just guess it by the content. not that i disagree much though. most of the media is under his control, and people will blindly follow it. deport all bjp anti-nationals to nepal. let pros: spectacular work with road, railways, metro, bridges, border infrastructure, limiting chinese investment, controlling tax leaks and rise in gst collection, low inflation despite ukraine crisis & massive printing of usd during covid cons: too little income tax benefits to middle class. europe notices price rise of 30%in 3 years and some of developed european country doesn’t have any fiscal deficit so it’s purely driven by post covid policies and ukraine war india is seeing honeymoon currently and if govt were to curb corruption at state govt levels then we can see massive churning of economy thanks to demonetisation which was useless policy but led to digitisation and tracking of individual income > too little income tax benefits to middle class. that has been the issue with more than 70 years.","A detailed post outlines a strategy to counter BJP's 2024 campaign, characterizing it as relying on the Ram Mandir issue and the TINA ('There Is No Alternative') factor.

[singh’s emphasis on empowering all vulnerable sections, including muslims, was not exclusive but aimed at promoting equitable development]( **now the question is- why hate and fake narratives are so acceptable in indian politics?** why is it acceptable? because that’s what a lot of the population also thinks. the strength of the bjp is not in oppressing minorities, but catering to the masses that openly feel that way. this reason is why i believe the bjp has done so well in the past couple of elections. numbers speak for themselves, and when a majority of the country votes for a man who’s actions in the past have clearly led to the harm of a minority community, you can not help but wonder if they are unaware or if they choose to support the ideology. growing inequality leads to a scramble for diminishing resources (jobs, housing, education and healthcare) in this environment people look for easy ways to eliminate competition. to be honest, most of the people hate each other based on religion. their sole identities are based on caste, religion, or region. this has been the case for generations. due to lack of ability and aptitude to think on their own, this hate and discriminatory feelings are being passed down generation to generation. educated people are supposed to be uplifted above all this, but the truth is, the it hasn't helped. because, we are supposed to listen to our elders. so many young fellows, with brains, and with education, still fall for this hate because they are taught to listen to elders. even if their instincts indicate otherwise, they will suppress those and think that elders know better, and will believe in such hate. i saw the article where ec said they will be strict over religious statements and when pm modi does it anyway ec says ""no comments"" bharat mostly because as someone pointed out we're a poor country , deeply unequal. religion is culture, scientific enquiry is mostly a pursuit among few. and we have this innate must worship people tendency. therefore , it's easy to control large swathes of people by presenting information from people they deem to be respectable. we don't question people in power , it's innate to our culture and you end up with people being easily manipulated","A detailed fact-check and critique of PM Modi's controversial statements in Rajasthan regarding Muslims and wealth redistribution.

1cpdea2,"electoral politics is about choosing the lesser evil... and india alliance is exactly that. i reckon there are too many undecided apolitical people who say bjp and congress are two sides of the same coin. however, the truth is that congress and the india alliance may be bad, but they are certainly not worse than bjp. some of the undecided apolitical people may feel alienated by congress' ""radical"" push for more affirmative action and the caste census, but i don't think it makes congress akin to bjp. bjp engages in blatant communal bigotry. it uses central agencies like the ed to serve political vendetta. the press freedom and academic freedom indices go down almost every year. during the upa era, the media talked about their scams, but no media criticizes the government now. up's cm openly orders dms to investigate any media reports criticizing the government. as for the caste census, i believe that the congress party, which fought the last two elections on milquetoast centrism, felt that it needed an ideology (mandal) to counter hindutva politics (kamandal) . historically, this was the forte of parties like sp and rjd and not the congress. in fact, historically congress and bjp's stances on ""caste politics"" were pretty similar. i personally agree with the idea of a socioeconomic caste census as the data revealed by the one conducted in bihar provides a lot of data to work with. it reveals the massive inequalities in resources. however, congress's aggressive push has also resulted in bjp getting defensive on the issue of affirmative action and getting slightly desperate vis-a-vis reservation. they are now trying to communalize congress' aggressive push for affirmative action and talk about how nehru and rajiv gandhi opposed reservation. the truth is that this is only rhetoric. when it comes to ""caste politics"", even bjp has breached the 50% ceiling in several states, although the supreme court stalled it in some cases. in haryana, after the jat agitation, the bjp government brought 10% obc reservation for jats even though they are a dominant landowning community who own most of the land in the state. in maharashtra, they brought a 10% quota for marathas, who are a dominant caste, breaching the 50% ceiling. centrists who don't like the bjp, but oppose ""caste politics"" must also contend with this. of course, this is not to say that the opposition didn't support these bills. they also supported the bills for the same reason bjp did. i would also like to point out the 10% ews reservation brought by the bjp also breached the 50% ceiling. the bjp advertised it as the first reservation for general castes. was it not ""caste politics""?? i mean the definition of ews is so lax that nearly everyone in the general category is included. (less than 5% of families earn over 8 lpa, although privileged people like us may think otherwise) even if you think from the perspective of someone who doesn't like ""caste politics"", i think bjp has all the problems that exist in the congress, apart from communalism and authoritarianism. congress is clearly the lesser evil. difficult to decide which is lesser evil at this moment. atleast we should keep cycling power centers to stop politicians to become too arrogant change is more important otherwise government thinks its their home and try to do whatever they want tmc is lesser evil? lmao. at least congress, bjp won't come knock on my door if i don't vote for them. and lalu's party? no thanks. i don't want to live in bihar. is this a troll post? who would have thought that congress will turn to look better than modi after 10 years.","A lengthy argument persuading voters to choose the 'lesser evil' (INDIA alliance) over the BJP.

1bfcwqb,"the logic that just because bjp is a bigger party therefore it should have more funds doesn't make sense. i can understand why you think this logic makes sense. but this logic is flawed for the following reasons 1) parties get funded to run election campaigns and various political activities. these funds are not based on how many seats you win but rather how many seats you compete for. for example congress would be competing with them for the same seats. both would have to incur costs. so the number of seats they occupy isn't a fair measure but how many seats they run for would be the main criteria. 2) the funding received could be a little more or less based on the support they get from the general population, but these differences shouldn't be very significant because donations are from general population. 3) the fundings received here are from corporates and is much more than what is required for election campaigns. the corporates can't just donate money. managers of listed companies are agents of shareholders (the general public). 4) people who are insisting that corporates do this in other countries. first of all, lobbying is illegal in india. why? because a company may want to push agendas which might not be in line with the public's interest. the idea that just because you have more money, you have more influence would result in very significant income inequality resulting in rich people getting richer and poor people getting poorer. 5) the countries where lobbying is legal, they'll have a lot of corruption going on. having them as our gold standard is completely wrong. secondly, even those countries have proper rules related to lobbying. this would still be illegal in those countries and termed as unethical lobbying. 6) a ruling party receiving funds is without any doubt can be deduced as quid pro quo. we might give certain companies projects not based on the quality/cost but how much money they are donating. this leads to tunnels collapsing, poor infrastructure and very less efficieny of taxpayer's money. 7) a company doesn't give this amount of money if they're not getting more value from it. it's an investment for them and the returns are much more. it's not a ""donation"" at all. ps - downvoters, can you also debate me? got banned from r/indiaspeaks for this post guys. didn't even get to mention the tax rebates these corporations are going to receive on donating to these bonds. bhakts are actually asking what's wrong with a corporate donating money to the elected party for the growth of their business. i'm ctfu. its bribery in broad daylight. these corporates are getting away with crores worth of tax fraud. the tax money is this country's money. while yall pay upto 43% of income tax, these people get away without even committing their 30% & handing out an annual soan papdi for their employees. the govt. is loading its bank with fuck ton for its election campaigns and hoardings and buying off votes and ministers. just because the precious supreme leader legalised bribery, doesn't mean it's something saint. the silence on other sub about this topic is deafening that was just a first responder knee jerk response. please expect a point by point rebuttal and a deflection shortly, if that doesn't work a distraction is coming. profits for corporates, taxes for individuals read more at: a lot is riding on the victory of the bjp downvoters, can you also debate me? lol , they've gone from atleast modiji's not corrupt to atleast modiji's less corrupt than congress . . >downvoters, can you also debate me? they are silently brig@ding down voting and reporting every posts here.","A user argues against the justification that 'bigger parties get more funds', listing reasons why corporate funding without limits leads to policy capture and inequality.

1dh4p91,"one reason for bjp's poor performance is not discussed | ""winning"" close seats i think one reason for bjp's poor performance is not discussed much. dr. sabyasachi in his [paper]( titled ""democratic backsliding in world's largest democracy"" clearly showed that in 2019, bjp won a disproportionate amount of close seats. the main graph in that paper is the following figure. this is a histogram (counts) where the x-axis is %-margin of victory divided by 100 in the seats bjp won or ended up as the runner up. a negative win margin implies bjp lost that seat with that amount of margin whereas a positive win margin implies bjp won that seat. when the election is very close in a particular seat, it is basically a toss up and hence should roughly win as many seats it loses. therefore the following graph should be continuous at 0. we see a clear discontinuity indicating bjp somehow won a much higher number of close seats than it lost. compare this with the win margin of congress in 2019 a continuous graph at 0 implying there that it lost as many seats as it won when those seats are very close. you can also look the same graph for 2009 and 2014 elections for bjp once again, a continuous graph at the origin which is what we should expect in a fair election (especially in a country like india). **this clearly indicates that in 2019, bjp gained seats using manipulation**. the author, using some excellent analysis, estimates that bjp gained around 9-11 ""excess seats"" last time. he also analyses the details of how they ""stole"" these seats such as removing muslim names from electorate, mismatch of votes from evm, assignment of counting observers, turnout manipulation in high muslim share areas and pliability in bjp ruled states. i highly recommend the paper. now, coming back to 2024 election, i plotted the data to get a histogram and obtained the following: **this time the graph is continuous at 0 implying that bjp couldn't/didn't steal the close ""excess seats"" for whatever reason.** it would be interesting to find the reasons for this. last time, most of these ""excess seats"" were from local parties and independents (as congress graph is continuous rather than downward discontinous). tldr: just see the last figure. really appreciated this post. thanks op that you gave the background of the previous study and tldr of sabyasachi paper along with these graphs. this is efforts post. however, it would have been better if you could made graph with same variables (density vs %/100). yes this is just scaling the graphs but it helps in comparison. so if it is possible, update the graph with same variables. swing voters actually decide the fate of these close seats. it could be that in 2019, the narrative of ""modi the protector of the realm"", that was created post pulwama pushed a lot of them towards the bjp. so we see a discontinuous graph at origin. 2009 & 2024 had no such narratives among the general public. 2014 did have a narrative of ""modi the prince that was promised"", which could have pushed the graph up giving some discontinuity around the origin, especially in bjp ruled states at the time, as you can see in above graphs. my personal opinion on this: its really difficult to game elections in india, merely due to the size of the entire exercise and the no of people involved. but i'm a 100% sure that modi would have tried very hard. but he failed in most part. one major reason why bjp didn't 'win absolutely' was low voter turnout and arrogance. people who tend to left would see elections as a duty to defend rights while those who tend right see it as a way to enforce their will. modi probably felt like god and didn't push the narrative far enough- no terror attacks/no soldier,civilian deaths/no riots. just blah, blah... along with anti incumbency, he lost that golden warrior image. personally, i don't think dhruv and others made much difference. educated people are bigoted because they choose to be. muslims are used as a scarecrow to ensure hindus unite in fear/jealousy. but this is a 78% hindu nation. 14 % muslims are shown as villians along with 2.3% christians as mass conversion machines and 1.7% sikhs as traitors. bjp could be compared to crony politico who rig the system to their advantage by making the majority shackled to its ideology and minority in fear. bjp could have easily pulled fear of other religions out by creating govt machinery to control conversions, state monitored madrassa system etc what we are forgetting is that there was a massive alliance this time, the margin is less because votes were consolidated for 2 alliances, a candidate winning with 1 vote is still a winner how can win margin be same when sp voters voted for congress and congress voters for sp? what you are doing is looking for excuses to keep yourself happy but lets accept that bjp did win the election and failed only because they wanted 400 seat, if their slogan was ""teesri baar modi sarkaar"", they would have won the war of narrative too. op also add that the professor had to resign for this paper. so it adds a doubt to the govt's intentions. are they really hiding something. also, surprise surprise, there was an ed raid on the ashoka university after this.","A detailed statistical analysis argues that BJP's poor performance in 2024 compared to 2019 is due to the inability to 'win close seats' through manipulation.

representatives from the concerned panchayat or municipality will be consulted before undertaking such projects.| these are the points where i felt a comparison was possible. after reading both manifestos, i feel bjp's focus is on visible infrastructure development. this is reinforced through their promises of expanding roads, modernising train stations, introducing high speed railways (eg. bullet trains) and increasing the number of international airports. this is good, and these facilities will be of particular interest to the upper middle class folks (like me, and probably most of this subreddit). bjp reaffirms its support for the ram temple by promising ramayan festivals throughout the world that celebrate the temple's consecration. it also reaffirms its support for caa, uniform civil code and one nation one election. the manifesto completely ignores the situation in manipur and does not answer when centre's rule will be lifted in kashmir. congress, on the other hand, focuses on social justice. it calls for civil union for lgbt couples, talks of forcing increased representations for marginalsed communities, aims to implement farmer's demands, restore the independence of india's institutions and promises to safeguard individual liberty. in my opinion, the choice is between the promise of visible indicators of development (high speed trains, multiple airports) but an unequal society (with minorities persecuted and wealth disparity) and a country with basic but not fancy infrastructure (think more normal trains but no bullet trains) and the promise of a more equal society (where the state does not discriminate on the basis of faith and actively promotes marginalised communities). damn bjp literally have nothing but modi........ their manifesto is so dull with 80% of it being policies and schemes that are already in service with lackluster implementation and other 20% being vague assurances with directionless administration....... like wtf does implementing a law making to paper leaking illegal mean??? when the fuck was it legal to leak papers did you count the number of pictures of modi in the bjp sankalp patra? call me a selfish asshole who doesn’t care about the other people in the society. but the only thing in these two manifestos impacting me directly as a student is the reservation plan of congress. that is big no from me. i just hope to get a good college this year and get the fuck out outta this race. other than the woman reservation i am all for the congress manifesto. it's sustainable and actually works towards the benefit of the downtrodden. the bjp manifesto is peek jumla, i expect nothing but misery from them. i think we are missing a point here? when all said and done?? don't you think some of these proposals might not see the light of the day. also, they may take idk how many years. moreover, even if they are somehow legislated their implementation can't be guaranteed.","A comprehensive

1abad4s,"a desecration of the republic, and our tryst with destiny when the preamble to the constitution of india was being drafted, there was a debate on god. hv kamath, member of the constituent assembly, had moved an amendment to replace, “we, the people of india”, with “in the name of god, we, the people of india”. the amendment was fiercely debated by the constituent assembly, and was finally put to vote. there were 41 ayes and 68 noes. we gave to ourselves a secular constitution. we adopted a democratic republic, which drew its authority from the people of india, not from a divine sanction. our leaders were to be elected by the people, not appointed by the god. after a long struggle and countless sacrifices, india had awoken to life and freedom, and we decided to rid ourselves of the past, and walk into a new future that beckoned us. however, there were challenges ahead, and many apprehensions about the future of this republic. in a speech to the constituent assembly, on 4 november 1948, dr ambedkar, noted the importance of constitutional morality, > constitutional morality is not a natural sentiment. it has to be cultivated. we must realize that our people have yet to learn it. democracy in india is only a top-dressing on an indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic. he further cautioned against the perversion of the constitution, > it is perfectly possible to pervert the constitution, without changing its form by merely changing the form of the administration and to make it inconsistent and opposed to the spirit of the constitution. on 25 november 1949, in his final speech to the constituent assembly, dr br ambedkar further warned against the misuse of the constitution, > however good a constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot > the working of a constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of the constitution. the constitution can provide only the organs of state such as the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. the factors on which the working of those organs of the state depends are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics. india had achieved her freedom in a non-violent democratic struggle, which was exceptional in history. yet, there were many fault lines in the new nation. india was a nation of diverse religions, languages, cultures, and castes. our freedom struggle had united india, beyond these divisions. yet, there were many groups who saw this diversity as a threat and wanted to impose their narrow understanding upon the nation. dr ambedkar noted, > on 26th january 1950, india will be an independent country. what would happen to her independence? will she maintain her independence or will she lose it again?… will history repeat itself? it is this thought which fills me with anxiety. this anxiety is deepened by the realization of the fact that in addition to our old enemies in the form of castes and creeds we are going to have many political parties with diverse and opposing political creeds. will indian place the country above their creed or will they place creed above country? i do not know. but this much is certain that if the parties place creed above country, our independence will be put in jeopardy a second time and probably be lost for ever. this eventuality we must all resolutely guard against. **we must be determined to defend our independence with the last drop of our blood.** in many ways, on 22 january 2024, fears and apprehensions expressed by dr ambedkar came true. as a leader elected by the people proclaimed himself as one appointed by the god, as a consecration of a temple took place on the desecration of the republic, as a secular state used all the political and administrative power to hail it as the true freedom, as the democracy was turned into a theocracy, our constitution was torn to shreds. it is said that, after the constitution of the us was adopted, someone asked benjamin franklin whether they had got a republic or a monarchy. to this, benjamin franklin replied, “a republic if you can keep it”. for long years, we took our republic for granted. we ignored the mobs who sought to turn a secular nation into a hindu rahstra. we ignored the attempts to turn the democratic republic into a theocratic autocracy. while thousands marched to destroy this constitution, few marched to defend it. we could not uphold this constitution, bestowed upon us by our freedom fighters. we could not protect this republic, for which countless people gave their lives. we could not preserve the dream of our leaders like mahatma gandhi, jawaharlal nehru, babasaheb ambedkar, maulana azad, bhagat singh. and we failed in the responsibility entrusted upon us. the question that remains before us is, will we turn our back to this adversity, will be surrender our republic to those who betrayed our freedom movement, will we be the generation that failed? or will be fight back? on this very day, when jawaharlal nehru gave the call for purna swaraj, and when the constitution of india came into force, or nation stands at a crossroads. it is a moment of reckoning in our collective tryst with destiny. the country's future hangs between hope and despair. another term for the bjp-rss at the centre could mean formal rewriting and de-facto abrogation of the constitution. dethroning the current regime by democratic means is necessary to keep alive a functional democracy that provides space for dissent, opposition, struggle, and resistance. friends, we cannot afford to remain neutral, when our nation is in crisis. we cannot remain ashore, when the values of our freedom struggle is under attack. we cannot remain silent, when our constitution and our democracy is being dismantled. today, the time has come to redeem our pledge. to stand together against the assault on democracy. to unite against the dismantling of our constitution. to fight against the hatred and oppression. friends, **the time has come to renew our pledge,** we, the people of india having solemnly resolved to constitute india into a sovereign socialist secular democratic republic and to secure to all its citizens: justice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; equality of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation; in our constituent assembly this twenty-sixth day of january, 2024, do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this constitution. link: [a desecration of the republic, and our tryst with destiny]( also, please read, [the 2024 general election is a do or die moment for indian democracy : indiansocialists]( [let the die be cast: countering bjp's campaign ahead of the 2024 general election : indiansocialists]( the problem is, those who read this fully, are already frustrated with current state of affairs and are already worried about the outcome of another term. the ones who need to wake up, will not read beyond the first 2 lines.. irony! it's scary how correct dr. ambedkar was even 75 years ago, indian society is still very undemocratic. excellent thoughts please keep writing. how can i support your work? there is only one response to this: let's vote. we get a chance to express ourselves in may 2024. let's resolve to remind those who would seek to weaken the constitution that we, the people, still believe fully and truly in it. the bifurcation of the subcontinent between one majority-muslim country and one majority-hindu nation did not come about peacefully. if people now aghast at the bjp's attempt to create a hindu-supremacist bharat at the expense of its minorities really want to address it, it must first come to terms with its history, including the history of its founding as a modern nation.","A reflective essay titled 'A Desecration of the Republic' draws parallels between Dr. Ambedkar's warning about placing creed above country and the events of January 22, 2024 (Ram Mandir consecration).

1cfsxiz,"prashant bhushan accuses judge of political dog-whistling, must read sc evm’s order >paragraph 5 of justice dipankar datta’s concurring opinion in the supreme court’s 26th april judgment on the question of electronic voting machines [evms] and vvpat verification (association for democratic reforms vs election commission of india) proceeds as follows: >>it is of immediate relevance to note that in recent years, a trend has been fast developing of certain vested interest groups endeavouring to undermine the achievements and accomplishments of the nation, earned through the hard work and dedication of its sincere workforce. there seems to be a concerted effort to discredit, diminish, and weaken the progress of this great nation on every possible frontier. any such effort, or rather attempt, has to be nipped in the bud. no constitutional court, far less this court, would allow such attempt to succeed as long as it (the court) has a say in the matter. i have serious doubt as regards the bona fides of the petitioning association when it seeks a reversion to the old order. >there are two things to note about this paragraph. >first, the judge levels a range of allegations in the first two sentences, but provides no evidence or particulars. he does not identify who these “vested interest groups” are. he does not specify what “the achievements and accomplishments of the nation” are, which are being “undermined” by these unnamed “vested interest groups.” he does not clarify what the “concerted effort” is that is being made by (presumably) the same unnamed “vested interest groups.” he does not explain what “progress of this great nation” is being weakened, and how, and by whom. there is a term for such language, and it is called a “dog-whistle.” >the second issue in this paragraph is the judge’s gratuitous personal attack upon the petitioner, the association for democratic reforms. i will not here write a screed defending the adr: their two-and-a-half-decades’ worth of work is in the public domain, it speaks for itself, and they do not need anyone to speak on their behalf. notice, however, how – much like the first part of the paragraph – the judge provides no evidence for doubting adr’s bona fides; in fact, the only reason for that, that comes out of the judgment, seems to be the judge’s outrage at the suggestion of replacing evms with paper ballots this absolutely true, we should stop pretending that these judges are independent, sc have been long compromised, and when something good judgement comes out which should have happen 5 years ago we start hero worshiping these judges as if they are last beacon of hope for democracy. the bench fixing, inaction against grave human rights violations, all the drama on chandigarh electoral officer but no action against him. they do bear minimum that too 5 years too late and we celebrate them as gods. even the collegium have submitted to authority when government doesn't approve their nominations for judges appointment and nominate the judges that the govt wants instead. when we have one sc judge in parliment with the bjp how can anyone blame anybody when they feel sc is compromised. how can i be sure no other judge will gain any favors from govt in future in return for vvpat judgement. sanjiv khanna is hearing arvind kejriwal's case today. guess we know what's gonna happen. saheb might have a job lined up. everyone will pay if not by law then by the hands of people. if i still don't get a job, i will start targeting these kind of people. like dexter. it takes phenomenal boot-licking skills, to malign an organisation like adr (association for democratic reforms).","Prashant Bhushan criticizes Supreme Court Justice Dipankar Datta's opinion in the EVM/VVPAT judgment.

1cz7ejg,"prashant kishore is more than what he seems on the surface… with another recent karan thapar's ""jal lijiye"" moment, pk is being trolled left and right, for which he should be honestly. he lost his cool in a pretty cringe way, and even though i believe that karan was purposefully baiting him throughout the interview to re-emphasize the same point about bjp winning majority and questioning his confidence and credibility. pk should have the grace to handle a man like karan as he has done numerous times in previous interviews with karan. as for the ""prediction"" shown on the screen of prashant tweet was exaggerated as his tweet said. *“i’ve been repeatedly asked to comment on the outcome of #udaipurchintanshivir in my view, it failed to achieve anything meaningful other than prolonging the status-quo and giving some time to the #congress leadership, at least till the impending electoral rout in gujarat and hp!”* he is telling his opinion about the impact of congress status-quo leadership though #udaipurchintanshivir which was in rajasthan, and will result only in “electoral rout” in gujrat and hp, congress lost gujrat which karan didn’t highlight, and pk didn’t gave any numbers like he gave in west bengal 2021 and for bjp 2024, also, inc won hp with 1% greater vote, so the margin was very close (inc=44.2% & bjp=43.2%). also, i didn’t find pk’s prediction for brs telangana anywhere as karan mentioned. still, pk was technically wrong and should’ve handled it better. ##so why i am making this post? because i noticed people weren’t only trolling him for losing his cool, but people were labelling him a bjp agent and sent by bjp and what not. if you look at pk’s history, he is the most anti-bjp person you can find, because he may not have criticised them as an influencer on their optics, but he has run against bjp in every election after he ran modi’s campaign in 2012 & 2014, when asked why he left, he said pm was not interested of his proposals to introduce lateral entry in political post, as he claimed most revolution in india has been possible by bringing people of speciality into the cabinet be it, green revolution, telecom revolution etc. he made jdu win bihar **defeating bjp** in 2015 he made congress win punjab **defeating bjp/aap** in 2017 he **lost congress** in up against bjp in 2017 (his only lost) he made ycp win andhra **against tdp/bjp** in 2019 he made aap win delhi **against bjp** in 2020 he made tmc win bengal **against bjp** in 2021 he made stalin win tamil nadu against aiadmk in 2019 now, you can say its business and he is doing it to earn money, how such a money driven person be a good person? and you may be right, he is doing it for himself, whatever his personal reasons be, but he is definitely not cosy to bjp. hell, he even pointed the 4 pillars of bjp’s dominance are **hindutva, nationalism, welfare & organisational force**. if congress can challenge them or give a counter to even 3 of these, bjp will lose. he said that modi is bjp’s star, but also their biggest weakness. because even though people vote modi in lok sabha, **modi’s ability to garner voter on this name for regional vidhan sabha is declining rapidly since 2019**. so, people are not voting bjp in vidhan sabha on modi’s name only anymore. he also said brand modi is declining as well, because even *their supporters are not mesmerized by him anymore, they will vote for him this time, but only because they think there’s no alternative.* he also said the level of resistance against bjp will rise in the 3rd term, because **bjp is ignoring the rural distress, unemployment & economic issues** by the poor people as their income is not increased in this tenure. tell me any other bjp agent who has the balls or clarity to say this about bjp. ##he was one of the most vocal critics of caa-nrc when he joined jd(u) after 2017, under nitish kumar, which later alliance with bjp, he resisted, as he was against bjp’s tactics of doing work after 2014, but he stayed for time because he wanted to develop bihar, he had three goals in mind. 1. thousands of *youths* should enter politics, as the median age of lok sabha has been increasing and increasing, he wanted to train young people who wanted some guidance and help them understand the nitty gritty of it. 2. he wanted *lateral entry* of experts in positions which require it. so that we can get more innovative and creative ways to grow our sectors, he gave examples of the green revolution, telecom revolution, etc. 3. there should be *decentralisation of power.* from centre to state and state to local. he believes right now, resources are controlled too much by the people above and although it would take years, it still is a necessity. **now to caa-nrc**, he was very vocal that even though caa maybe alright, nrc will create a divide in society based on religion that shouldn’t exist in our country. he made multiple tweets begging non-bjp states to reject this bill. he shouted in interviews that bjp can’t strongarm non-bjp states, if they decided to reject it, he was confident that bihar will never accept it. but nitish kumar voted for it the parliament, this made pk leave jdu, as he was wholly disappointed with nitish and his decision. ##what’s his ideology, what he believes in then? if you scour his interviews, whenever he has been asked this question, he says that he is a believer of gandhi. he quotes him frequently and has a banner of it on his twitter profile ""the best politics is the right action”. his ideology lies with the congress, centre left. he believes in the wisdom of crowds, that people are smart enough and will tell you what they want, if you listen to them carefully without thinking they are poor hence lack intelligence. **he believes india will always have an opposition as only 38% hindus voted for the bjp, hence 62% people are still not satisfied with the hindutva narrative, so half hindus still not believe modi’s appeal, implying hope for the future of this country.** even though democratic values have taken a hit under modi as had under indira, he believes no single person can steamroll a population of 1.4 billion, unless they have more than 55% of the voter share. he was a public heath care manager working for un in chad, (i know), africa. for 10 years before his election journey, so he already has plenty of experience in public intervention and data analysis. in fact, he met modi for a paper he wrote on the child malnutrition epidemic in gujrat. ##now, why us liberals felt so strongly about his remarks on bjp? since the beginning of this year, we were certain that bjp is winning with a clear majority, even though india had some fuel, we were pretty sure who’ll win. but some things happen that changed the wave, electoral bonds put bjp on the back foot for the first time, even though only narratively. we started believing that maybe it’ll help, then ed arrested kejriwal, this was also very bad for bjp. so, we saw aha, then low voter turnout, modi’s mangal sutra, eci’s sleepiness, dhruv rathee’s explosive series unmasking all the propaganda, and positive feedback from the culture were taken as a at least we are winning culturally, so every mishap by bjp we thought, yes it’ll decrease votes or increase india’s chances, this was our resistance. but we made a mistake. we assumed that if india won culturally, it wiill transform electorally, but the reality is, **it takes months to reach the masses and that’s what prashant kishore exposed.** he himself said modi’s brand is decreasing, but it won’t really matter electorally as its too little too late. so, when he said it publicly it felt like all our efforts to resist the dictatorship were in vain. that’s why we started questioning his intentions & motives, as he isn’t criticizing bjp’s horrendous politics, but rather beating an already dead horse like the opposition, which needs are support. that’s what caused pain, i was also depressed, but deep down i think he’s right. because he is not saying these things after electoral bonds or kejriwal arrest or low voter turnout to build bjp’s momentum. he has been saying this for the last three months, since january. he maybe wrong or right, but his assessment is consistent, hence worthy to consider. and we liberals should at least, take his word seriously, as he is not just another mouthpiece for ‘saheb’, but one on the finest minds to enter politics in our time. my 2 cents. i didn’t even mention his jan suraaj moment, where he is doing pad yatra for the last 2 years in every village of bihar and preaching the values of “vote for the future of your child nor caste”, “vote of education” and self-governance. he claims to take bihar from the least developed state to the top 10 in the next 10 years. he did predict that congress will be routed. it is true that his statement has been exaggerated by reporters, but a dozen big newspapers published that as the headline. it is his responsibility to have been aware of this. he usually looks at the prevailing sentiment and explains its consequence. the statement under discussion is of this type. he does not do surveys or give accurate figures. he is often wrong, and most pollsters are often wrong. therefore a little humility would have been good. pk differs from armchair psephologists in giving actionable advise *before* elections, not just predictions and analysis of elections. he has been trying to bring about change, but has lacked opportunity to do much. his genuine criticisms of congress have always been interpreted as an attack by a bjp sympathizer. everything is polarized these days. i like prasant kishor and the way he thinks. but, in a country like india, you can't figure out which side a person is playing. we all fell into the trap of fraud anna hazare, and it took us more than a year to figure out his game was a sinister plan by the bjp, aka modi. everyone knows that rss plays a long-term game, engaging multiple players, creating a lot of social conflicts, etc., just like a spy organization ( even better, probably). so, we can't rule out the assumption that prasant is on that side—although i wish he is not. this fellow is the reason why modi is in power. think about it for a while. he helped bring the most incompetent uneducated set of goons to power; a historic feat. he identified the cracks in the polity and planted a poisonous banyan tree in a crack on the roof of the polity. pk is f\*\*\* fraud and a crook who deserves everything that happened to him on that interview plus some more. he is a prime example of how being at right place at right time makes you look so smart. the elections you listed, a blind idiot would have predicted the same thing. he just knows how to align with the winning side all the time. add a sprinkle of survivorship bias here and there. pk is just a bjp mole. pm's interviews were not able to generate any hype so bjp deployed kishor and he was giving 5+ interviews a day. he is literally not an important person. so why was that happening. well, and that interview caused a more damage to him and bjp's cause which is amazing. prashant is as narcissist as modi. there is only me or nothing.","A detailed defense of Prashant Kishor (PK) after he was trolled for his inaccurate predictions and loss of cool in an interview.

1cpmxol,"is the prolonged election season helping bjp or the opposition? in my opinion, the extended election season seems to be aiding the opposition in consolidating their efforts. last year, following the formation of the india alliance, the congress hesitated to actively push the alliance forward, hoping for better seat negotiation post-elections in states like telangana, rajasthan, mp, and chattisgarh. however, this strategy was risky, potentially painting the perception of the alliance as non-serious and non-committed just like the alliance came together for 2019 elections, post which they had no consolidated efforts (like they should have started this alliance in 2021/22 , since everyone knew there are going to be lok sabha elections in 2024) had they pursued seat sharing and their common minimum agenda vigorously, it could have allowed their message to reach the grassroots effectively. nevertheless, dwelling on past choices serves no purpose now. the current election dynamics seem to favor the opposition, particularly congress and its allies, whose target demographics mainly include rural residents, the poor, farmers, and unemployed youth. their proposed policies like reservations, msp, and dbt are tailored to appeal to these segments. meanwhile, bjp tends to fare better in urban areas among the salaried, middle class, and rich, who may be less inclined towards measures like reservation cap removal, “freebies or welfare whatever you call it” and wealth redistribution *(even if you assume everything for a minute they are going to snatch your private wealth and give it to the poor as opposed to giving more of govt revenue income to poor via schemes which is what all top leaders of congress have categorically said and clarified - no im not defending them )* congress itself knows that it is going to cost them urban votes but these section of people traditionally voted majorly for bjp, so its a calculated move to woo the rural and poor voters at the cost of urban votes. so the extended election season imo is actually helping the india alliance to do more rallies and give more time for their proposals and messages to percolate down in scattered, diverse and vast rural areas and finally whats the projected scoreboard according to you at the end of phase 3? in cricket terms, will this match be down to the last over and last ball or even superover (hung assembly and then post poll alliances) or will it be a easy win with good net run rate for the nda? india is definitely winning. the only problem is eci is under bjp's control so you never know. bjp thought it would be able to address every state, relied too much solely on ram mandir and modi's popularity. in spite of what the media says, opposition is getting to people. they've started to recognise that it is bjp to blame for unemployment, inflation etc. always remember, it's the poor people who will come out to vote in large numbers. i heard that their 400 paar slogan backfired too since sc/st/obc people are very scared about their reservation being snatched away. even the opposition is refusing to divert its attention from real issues so that's why modi's desperate attempt of hindu-muslim. expect the stock market to fall in the upcoming few days, modi to do some randi rona etc. if nda comes below 272, forget bjp coming into power. most of their alliance is forced. whether it's blackmailing the revanna party using his videos or nitish kumar. they've not giving tickets to their own party members. bjp is waiting to fuck these gujarati duos. if they fall below 272, expect ajit pawar, shinde, nitish kumar and some other alliances to flip and join the india bloc. definitely agree that bjp relied on ram mandir and the peak euphoria faded rather quickly. like it was 5 months ago…too much of gap for it to have an effect like 2019 pulwama/balakot yes opposition’s message of unemployment and inflation is reaching the masses and more and more people are talking about it. yes bjp leaders themselves realized their 400 par slogan backfired and they are not talking about it prominently in rallies. however will it be able to make enough dent in bjp/nda numbers to bring it below 272, which in and of itself will be great achievement of opposition considering the “unlevel” playing field, is to be seen… regarding polarisation, the north especially the hindi heartland is an area that is constantly under religious tensions, and this hindu muslim talks might actually work there in order to secure their votebanks… i mean take a look at their hardcore leaders , most of them talk anti muslim rhetoric every day and yet they continue to win im mentally prepared for the worst but i am hopeful about nda falling below 272. the moment nda falls below 272, the modi’s image will be dented and then bjp will have to rely more on its alliance partners (they have partnered with every party possible in the north) , which in and of itself will keep in check his authoritarian tendencies and image.. it can no longer be two man show (modi shah) and who knows these alliance partners and leaders might actually hop and switch their sides because one of the reasons for them to join nda might have been to escape investigative agencies.. interesting times ahead aptly said, in politics there are no permanent enemies and no permanent allies, only permanent opportunists ideally current india block should be able to make up for above 272 but its unlikely…so again these turncoats would be happily accepted by india bloc, that is annoying to me as a general public. if bjp comes below 272, may be around 250-260 then they will have a tough time to form the govt. i am not predicting no. of seats for bjp, i am talking about a scenario","Discussion on whether the prolonged election season benefits the BJP or the Opposition.

1cbpi9e,"congress's 2024 apprenticeship program is very revolutionary : details inside the indian national congress has recently unveiled an apprenticeship program in their 2024 manifesto, a move that promises substantial implications for the indian workforce and economy. here's a detailed analysis of how this program could potentially transform india's socio-economic landscape: **1. leveraging the population dividend:** india is at a critical juncture with its large young population, often referred to as the ""population dividend."" this demographic advantage can be a powerful growth engine but only if adequately harnessed. the proposed apprenticeship program aims to convert this demographic boon into a productive workforce by providing hands-on training and skills development. by doing so, the initiative not only prepares the youth for domestic job markets but also for global opportunities, thereby amplifying their employment prospects and contributing to economic growth. if we don't use this population dividend, it will only end up being population debt. [remember, below age of 25, half of the population is unemployed.]( check the picture above, imagine having half of your young blood wasted during these precious years. **2. reduction in future unemployment:** one of the persistent challenges in the indian job market has been the mismatch between the skills held by the workforce and those demanded by employers. the apprenticeship program directly addresses this by aligning training with real-world business requirements. apprentices gain practical experience and relevant skills in their chosen fields, which can significantly enhance their employability. this targeted skill development is expected to lower unemployment rates over time, particularly among the youth. [modi has failed our nation and our youth. ]( **3. boosting economic growth through skill enhancement:** enhanced skills lead to higher productivity, which is a direct contributor to economic growth. apprentices who exit these programs are not just workers; they are skilled professionals capable of contributing more effectively to their employers' output. this increase in productivity can lead to higher wages and better job satisfaction, which in turn fuels consumption and economic growth through increased spending. **4. encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation:** apprenticeships provide a unique ecosystem where individuals can learn not only the specifics of a job but also the nuances of industry operations. this exposure can foster innovation and encourage some to start their own businesses, thereby promoting entrepreneurship. entrepreneurial ventures can create new jobs and contribute to economic diversification. way better than having all these people sit around and do nothing. **5. impact on informal sector:** a significant portion of india's workforce is employed in the informal sector, often without any formal job training or security. the apprenticeship program can serve as a bridge for informal sector workers to transition into the formal economy, equipping them with necessary skills and potentially leading to better job security and working conditions. now i know most of the people on r/india are privileged and they might not understand the monumentality of this idea. i know most of you just get internships easy (not all of you, but many of you) and then dream of going to united states. but rest of the population have none of these privileges to dream even 1% of that. these provisions will bring a huge opportunity for them to have a significant opportunity of upward social mobility. but humko kya, humko toh dharam ke naam pe vote daalna hai. we are unemployed anyways :) aayega toh modi hee.... i think it’s one of the best (if not best) promise by congress. one of the major drawbacks in indian education system is that individual is not industry ready even after completing education. this program will help both company as well as youth. it should be implemented by bjp also if it forms govt. thats the best case scenario. in reality, you will just need a fake degree and fake internship to claim 1 lakh from govt. the scheme doesn’t promise a skilled training. how come vietnam numbers are so great? i just googled it, its about social structure. as long as any one member of the family is employed, nobody is unemployed.","An analysis praises Congress's 2024 apprenticeship program as 'revolutionary', arguing it addresses youth unemployment and leverages India's demographic dividend.

1bkw80f,"a dm from the pm.... (and the storm it stirred) | internet freedom foundation [ ## [help us watch the watchmen, donate now!]( ## tl;dr last week, the ministry of electronics & information technology used a government-run account to send a whatsapp message to millions of users, purportedly seeking feedback and suggestions on their governance. although the eci has asked meity to discontinue these messages given that the model code of conduct is in force, users were quick to raise pertinent questions about government access to such a database, the role of online communication platforms in facilitating formal government communication, the timing of the message in the context of the upcoming elections starting in april, and the regulations (or lack thereof) in place to safeguard our privacy. in this post, we unravel these questions in depth and document the actions we have taken in search of some answers. ## background from march 15, 2024 onwards, millions of whatsapp users received a message from a government-run account named ‘viksit bharat sampark’ seeking feedback and suggestions from indian citizens on existing welfare schemes, [adjoined with a letter]( from prime minister narendra modi. the letter enumerates reform efforts brought on by the incumbent government and their plans to “*work to fulfil the resolve of building a viksit bharat*” or ‘advanced india’. this missive was sent by the ministry of electronics & information technology (“meity”) and undersigned by the prime minister. there are a number of concerns and questions that emerge from this outreach. first, questions about data privacy of our contact information – where did meity secure the contact information of such a large database of users from? when did it begin using this information for outreach, arguably without their consent? is any of this in line with established data privacy norms? second is the question of why whatsapp was chosen as a medium for outreach, and what roles and responsibilities similar platforms have in context of political campaigns and elections. third, we look into how the soon-to-be-enacted digital personal data protection act (“dpdpa”) affects (or exempts) government actions along this line and what to expect when it is finally operationalised. lastly, we look at what this means in context of the upcoming general elections. sent only a few days ahead of the election commission of india (“eci”) issuing its model code of conduct (“mcc”), the message may also serve as a vessel for covert electoral campaigning in a manner that potentially flouts the mcc. on a positive note, on march 21, the eci took note of the several complaints it received stating that the message was being sent while the model code of conduct was in force, and [wrote]( to meity, instructing them to discontinue the messages and too send a compliance report at the earliest. ## a peek into meity’s contact book the first and most important question that emerges from this fiasco is – where did meity get my number from? it is not clear what database (one, or many?) meity has relied on to send out the broadcast, further made confusing by the fact that [individuals]( from uae and pakistan, who are not indian citizens, have received it too. this becomes more convoluted when we begin speculating upon the intent of the government to send out the message merely a few days before important guidelines on election campaigning over platforms come into effect (more on this in later sections) – if the intent is campaigning, why were individuals who are not indian citizens targeted? were there criteria based on which database(s) or recipients were chosen? what were the criteria? further, it may be the case that meity has obtained the database from another agency/authority, either public or private, but that raises doubts about the lawfulness of how it was obtained, or whether privacy norms (such as the obligation to take specific and informed consent before processing or using personal data for a purpose other than the purpose originally consented to) were followed. we have asked the ministry to clarify these doubts through an [rti request]( where we seek information on, among other things, the source of contact information, total number of messages sent, and costs incurred: ## but we have a data protection law, right? right? it is worth remembering that the government holds access to this extensive database (one, or many) in the absence of an operational data protection law. the dpdpa, 2023 is not in operation yet, but even when it gets enacted and its procedural rules notified, it may still not be able to adequately regulate data storage and sharing by the government. simply because section 17 of the act holds the power to exempt government and other public authorities from its very application at any given time. read more about how the dpdpa fails to safeguard our privacy [here]( ## a government dm on whatsapp was not on my 2024 bingo card while we are accustomed to receiving messages from the government through our telecom service providers, communication through an online communication platform has caught us off guard – making us question what statute/ law exactly allows this. whatsapp’s business messaging policy clearly states that a business account may only contact people on whatsapp if: “*(a) they have given you their mobile phone number; and (b) you have received opt-in permission from the recipient confirming that they wish to receive subsequent messages from you on whatsapp*”. whatsapp emphasises on the need to have informed consent of the users receiving the message and clear communication regarding the opt-in choice of the user. it also suggests best practices to create a high-quality opt-in experience: &#x200b; disappointingly, the message sent by the government does not declare how and when, if at all, users shared their mobile numbers and gave their consent/ opted-in to being contacted on whatsapp. the policy also states that the business account is “*responsible for and must secure all necessary notices, permissions, and consents to collect, use, and share people's content and information, including maintaining a published privacy policy, and otherwise complying with applicable law*.” since the dpdpa, 2023 is not yet operational, its provisions and limited safeguards will not apply to the government. clause 7 of the dpdpa, 2023 allows the data fiduciary to not obtain the informed consent of the data principal and assume the consent if the processing was considered necessary as per certain situations. it is worth noting that the dpdpa, 2023 varied from its 2022 iteration as it omitted “public interest” as one of the situations wherein consent may be deemed and data processed non-consensually. this was a positive development since the 2022 iteration failed to strictly define the situations in which it may be invoked and thus, could have been widely interpreted leading to misuse. notably, clause 7(b) gives state instrumentalities a concerning amount of liberty to process the personal data of data principals if the latter has previously consented to its processing or if such data is maintained by any instrumentality of the state. however, at the moment we are unable to decipher if such unsolicited and non-consensual outreach from the government would have been a violation of clause 7 of the act, since it is not yet in operation. ## outreach right before the elections? the timing is sus the message, broadcast to millions of people through whatsapp, may be viewed in the context of the upcoming elections as the communication happened around the time the [model code of conduct]( went into effect. [reports]( of the message being received by individuals surfaced as early as march 16, the same day the eci [announced]( the election dates. the mcc prohibits the party in power from the misuse of official mass media during the election period for partisan coverage of political news and publicity regarding achievements. the eci, through the mcc, also [prohibits]( the issuance of advertisements at the cost of the public exchequer in newspapers and other media during the election period. this may lead us to question - does the timing of the communication, which happened around the time the election dates were announced and the mcc went into effect, have potential electoral implications? on march 21, 2024, the eci wrote to meity, asking them to discontinue delivery of the messages on whatsapp. as per the letter, the eci received several complaints from individuals about getting the message from meity during the mcc period. the letter also notes that although the ministry sent out the messages on march 15, the system architecture and network limitations of the communication platform chosen by the government delayed the delivery. the eci also asked meity to send a compliance report at the earliest. we appreciate the eci for taking note of the complaints, enforcing the mcc, and instructing meity to discontinue the messages. ([ however, we also note that this kind of communication by meity is not new, especially with the general elections less than a month away. in the months leading up to elections, electoral candidates and political parties make large investments in campaigns, rallies, outreach, and other modes with which they can reach voters and influence popular vote. a prevalent way of doing this is targeted outreach or ‘[votebank politics]( where parties can appeal to certain socio-economic groups specifically by outlining the kind of welfare they can bring to the groups. in recent years, parties have resorted to questionable means of collecting demographic data for the purposes of targeted campaigning. by tapping into government databases and accessing beneficiary information across schemes, or by means of online ‘surveys’ and mobile apps, parties are able to extract a lot of personal information about voters and create 360° profiles to run extremely targeted campaigns. [this video]( by shivam shankar singh titled ‘weaponising data for politics’, explains how precisely parties are able to draw voter profiles from data accessed by dubious means. we are working on a detailed explainer on how this is done, and the privacy concerns emerging from the practice. meanwhile, we hope the eci keeps their momentum going after this incident, and engages more meaningfully on how political parties access personal data. ## what has iff done about it? much like several concerned people on the internet, we too have questions about this outreach. in the hopes for some answers, we have filed the above mentioned [rti application]( we have recently also published a [short video]( summarising concerns and efforts. we are additionally exploring all avenues, including potential legal challenges to the inadequate dpdpa, 2023 pushing for a rights-respecting data protection framework.

1b14qkg,"read our open letter to electoral candidates & parliamentary representatives on the impact of deepfakes on electoral outcomes [help us sustain the work we do ]( [ ## tl;dr the rapid advancement of generative ai technology is reshaping the political landscape, presenting both [challenges]( and [opportunities]( for the 2024 indian election. given that instances of creation, use, and dissemination of ai-generated synthetic media have surfaced in the [recent past]( both domestically and [internationally]( we request all indian political candidates and affiliated organisations to publicly commit not to use deepfakes technology to create deceptive or misleading synthetic content in the run-up to and during the 2024 general elections. ## why should you care? elections are the cornerstone of any democracy, and the legitimate and responsible use of technology can empower citizens in a way that harnesses the true potential of elections. the ethical use of technology has certainly served to increase electoral legitimacy, curb malpractices, and broaden outreach. however, the negative affordances of technology have the potential to create disruptions in the functioning of a fair and ethical election. advancements in technology have led to the emergence of sophisticated and complex systems that can deceptively alter the flow of information in digital and physical spaces. one such evolving and emerging technology is deepfakes – digital content that has been manipulated or synthesised using deep learning models to appear authentic – which may be circulated through various forms of media. given the low rates of media and information literacy as well as the divisive politics in the country, the severity of threats posed by synthetic media must be acknowledged at the earliest. ## our demands instances of creation, use, and dissemination of such ai-generated synthetic media have been increasing in the country, with use cases ranging from language translation to financial fraud (see [here]( [here]( and [here]( although the positive affordances of such a technology are several, the consequences of its misuse, especially in the election context, may be grave. while much of the focus of the incumbent government is on reiterating the obligations of platforms and identifying regulatory avenues to curb the spread of such content on social media platforms, there is also a pressing need to interrogate the use of deepfakes technology by political actors with the intent to impact electoral outcomes. although more broad-based research is required to establish that the circulation of synthetic media directly affects voting patterns, the use of deepfakes for disseminating misleading or deceptive narratives about political candidates and affiliated institutions may affect voter perspectives, sentiments, as well as their behaviour. targeted misuse of the technology against candidates, journalists, and other actors who belong to gender minorities, may further deepen inequities in the election. such methods, if widely employed, even have the potential to impact electoral outcomes, thus painting a concerning picture for electoral integrity. over the years, political parties have been able to establish sophisticated channels for information dissemination and campaigning, which can be used for the widespread circulation of manipulated media among voters. the ability to derail or discredit another candidate’s campaign or to even make false and fictitious claims to bolster one’s campaign existed in previous elections. however, the ability to do that in the upcoming elections with such generative technology, that is also readily and freely available to everyone, may have drastic implications on a large scale – such as voters being deliberately misinformed, affecting their ability to exercise their democratic right to cast a free and informed vote. given that instances of such misuse have surfaced in the recent past, both domestically and internationally, **we request all political candidates and affiliated organisations to publicly commit not to use deepfakes technology to create deceptive or misleading synthetic content in the run-up to and during the 2024 general elections** (see [here]( and [here]( we urge political representatives to oppose the use of such disinformation campaigns before elections and request them to be aware and take action against the physical circulation of synthetic content. ## what can you do? we shared the open letter with parliamentarians, union leevel and regional political parties, and their affiliated organisations to ask for their endorsement of this letter. this letter is also open for signatures from the public till march 01, 2024. if you are concerned with the misuse of synthetic media and its impact on our ability to cast an informed and free vote, please consider signing the letter. each signature strengthens our demands as well as our attempt to achieve free and fair elections.

19f7fgn,"""digital nagriks"" for a free, equal, and inclusive internet: our demands from the incoming union government &#x200b; the 2024 general elections to elect lok sabha members are slated to be an event of grandeur. with [over 900 million indian voters]( geared up to vote a new union government to power, the focus will soon shift to promises, development agendas, and governance priorities of political parties in the running. in that context, iff has attempted to list out a [seven-point agenda]( on technology and human rights that can be adopted by electoral candidates and political parties in their party manifestos for the 2024 general and state elections. more indians are online today than ever before. a [hindu report]( from may 2023 speculates that half the indian population now has access to the internet. at the outset, the numbers paint a positive picture – the country’s digital divide, a gaping problem that alienates many groups from reaping the benefits of digital technologies recreationally as well as for better quality of life, is seemingly being bridged. the increasing adoption of the internet also signals a continuing belief that it has the potential to make our lives better. but on a closer look, we see that the internet is also being wielded as a tool of arbitrary executive control by our government, which deepens the divide and excludes vulnerable communities. instances of indefinite and disproportionate internet shutdowns, threats to net neutrality, tech-enabled gender violence – all indicate that while indians are online, our engagement with the internet is not necessarily meaningful or fructuous. a free, equal and inclusive internet can only be ensured when the rights of users are written into the law, and our institutions invest their time and resources in building rights-affirming, secure and trustworthy legal mechanisms for us to safely make the most of the internet. sometimes, we find that our government slips up on this legitimate expectation. their interests may misalign with ours – as can be seen from the wide array of flawed or underdeveloped tech-policy regulatory developments that have been enacted in the last few years. but our demands for rights-centric legislation and good governance must not stop. as ""digital nagriks"", a title endowed upon citizens of a “digital india” by the digital personal data protection act, 2023, we must continue to participate in our democracy and hold our governments accountable for the protection, preservation, and advancement of our constitutionally guaranteed digital rights. we, at iff, noted the absence of a clearly articulated message or political charter of demands surrounding the use of digital technologies in india. this seven-point agenda has been created to fill that gap. we attempted a similar exercise in 2019 – where we [presented a set of demands]( and reached out to all political parties and candidates to open a channel of communication. this year, we have streamlined these demands into seven broad themes of governance. ### i. digital rights are human rights the incoming government must support and advocate for protecting and expanding our fundamental human rights in the realm of digital technologies, with a focus on constitutional principles of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity. with growing digitisation and more indians coming online, the human rights impact of digital technologies has become a core governance issue, which must be implemented through executive and legislative action. the government must apply systemic solutions to systemic problems such as cybersecurity threats and online harms, while preserving our security through the adoption of privacy-protecting technologies. the protection and advancement of the digital rights of individuals and collectives must become a governance priority. ### ii. technology should lead to inclusion and equality the incoming government must ensure greater access to the internet and to digital technologies – access that is physical, educational, monetary, intersectional, and equitable. internet penetration must increase in remote corners of the country to secure the right of every indian to communicate, send, and receive information and to bridge the digital divide. no person should be excluded from government services, benefits, or entitlements due to the adoption of e-governance services or digitisation, and the delivery of welfare services must not be impeded due to technical failures or inaccessibility. the government should empower those from backgrounds and identities who can use technology for a better, more productive life across boundaries of religion, caste and gender. ### iii. free speech must be respected the growing presence of indians in online spaces reinforces the need to protect their freedom of speech and expression as well as their right to receive information online. reinterpretation or replacement of antiquated laws must not be employed as a means to suppress dissenting and vulnerable voices and to solidify disproportionate power with the executive. while an online attack on the freedoms and rights of others must be countered with effective measures, the incoming government must ensure that legitimate, constitutional rights are protected and promoted. neither the government nor the platforms can become sole arbiters of online free speech, in the absence of judicial safeguards. the government must oppose the disproportionate, unreasoned, and non-transparent suspension of the internet. india’s troublesome performance in globally renowned indexes measuring internet shutdowns and online speech censorship is a cause for alarm, and the government must safeguard fundamental and human rights in online domains, preventing any authoritarian abuse of power. ### iv. upholding informational privacy protection of privacy, as articulated by a nine-judge bench of the supreme court in the two *puttaswamy v. union of india* judgments (2017 and 2019), is indispensable to a digital india. to ensure that the informational privacy of all indians is protected, the incoming government must commit to building a rights-affirming digital environment with adequate channels for grievance redress. the data protection legislation must be amended to meet the standards of privacy and principles of proportionality set out by the supreme court in the *puttaswamy* judgments. the government must implement robust data processing, storage and sharing mechanisms in line with internationally accepted principles. at the same time, the right to information and the rti act, which is a significant pillar of democratic governance, must not be diluted. ### v. checks on surveillance in order to preserve the privacy, dignity, and freedom of movement of indian citizens, there is a critical need to establish proper safeguards and oversight over digital surveillance by the executive. legal safeguards and processes with adequate checks and balances must be created for surveillance by police and intelligence agencies, to prevent misuse and targeted or mass surveillance of individuals. the incoming government must introduce long overdue reform in surveillance practices and powers of the executive, with sufficient legislative and judicial oversight on any interception of digital devices, including computer access and phone tapping. the role of intrusive, emerging technological use-cases such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition in surveillance must be closely reevaluated, and privacy impact assessments conducted before deploying such tools. the government must protect and encourage the adoption of encryption technologies like end-to-end encryption, and eliminate the use of spyware as a tool for surveillance. ### vi. making consumer facing digital platforms accountable india is a valuable market for companies globally, with indians forming a bulk of their user base. in exchange for establishing a presence on and using the services of these platforms, users are unknowingly relinquishing effective control over how they interact with technology. legislative, regulatory, and policy measures are needed to effectively ensure an equitable balance of company interests and individual rights, in a way that the former respects the fundamental right to free speech and privacy. technology companies as well as the government must strive to serve the public’s best interests instead of protecting company profits. to that end, the incoming government must ensure that companies adopt measures for greater transparency and accountability through tools such as a human rights impact assessment. ### vii. ensuring legitimate use of generative ai the legitimate use of generative ai for reasons such as translation or authorised dubbing of audio-video content to reach a broader audience can achieve positive outcomes. however, the unauthorised use of such technology for nefarious use to create manipulated media can have devastating consequences, including financial fraud, defamation, impersonation, etc. in light of the existing limitations of detection tools and redressal capabilities of platforms and companies, the incoming government must commit to not creating and/or using manipulated media for nefarious reasons as government actors and otherwise. the government must create solutions at the legal, policy, and societal levels for such emerging technologies in a way that balances the right to online free legitimate and legal speech and the right to receive information. in addition to working towards building technical capacity within the government and its allied organisations to tackle these emerging threats, media literacy should be a priority both in the digital and physical space, to raise awareness about the existence of and threats posed by these technologies. ## as always, we can’t do this without you here’s how you can

1b0ex4k,"investors want to both give and not give byju's more money *original source:* [* \-- sometime mid of last year people got to know of a bunch of financial soups edtech company byju’s had found itself in. it had been [overstating]( its revenue, its auditor was unhappy and had [resigned]( it was late in filing its financials by two years. \[1\] it had also [defaulted]( on a $1.2 billion loan in the us and had been sued by its lenders who were dead set to recover every last penny from the company. basically byju’s wasn’t doing well financially. and well, most of it was a result of its own doings. given this situation, if you happen to be a byju’s board member, it’s not the most pleasant place to be in. in some sense, *you* are responsible. the company fell into this mess on your watch. you were the investors’ representatives and you clearly didn’t do a great job in keeping an eye out for their interests. but you *might* not be responsible. byju’s is a company with an assertive, even firebrand founder in byju raveendran, and such firebrand founders often receive a free hand from venture capital investors to run their company whatever way they like. sometimes, the founders deceive their board members. as a board member, how you go from here depends on what you’re willing to admit. do you own up to your mistake? the founder may have done all the bad things but ultimately you were responsible. you’ve now got to admit your folly, switch course, even poke your nose in everyday company affairs which you wouldn’t have thought to do earlier. as a board member, you guide the company out of this. you would influence other board members, ratify the decisions you think are good, reject the ones that are bad. do your job! but you do have to admit that you were responsible. not easy. the alternative is that you claim that the founder did stuff that you had absolutely no flipping idea about. you’re not responsible, you’re the victim! in this case, one of the things that might seem reasonable to do is resigning from the board. “wow the founder really duped me here,” is the message you want to send out.. “on a moral level, i can’t be part of this anymore.” three large byju’s investors—prosus, peak xv partners and chan zuckerberg initiative—who were on the company board [chose the second path]( they resigned from the board last july. sure, the board-resigning investors didn’t want their reputation at risk because of the crap byju’s might have done. but the flip side of resigning from the board is that you no longer have a say in decisions which require board approval. and sometimes you might *really* not like those decisions. earlier this month byju’s announced that it was raising money from existing investors via a rights issue at a 99% drop in valuation. the board-resigners didn’t like it too much. from [techcrunch]( >a group of byju’s investors on friday voted to remove the edtech group’s founder and chief executive byju raveendran and separately filed an oppression and management suit against the leadership at the firm to block the recently launched rights issue in a surreal moment for the startup, once india’s most valuable. > >at an emergency general meeting (egm) that concluded earlier today, a group of investors including prosus ventures and peak xv partners voted to change the leadership at the startup. the participating shareholders — whose combined ownership in byju’s exceeded 60%, according to an investor source familiar with the matter — also passed the resolution to reconstitute byju’s board. (two people close to byju’s disputed that participating shareholders held over 60% ownership in the firm. neither of the sides have issued an official statement on the figures.) byju’s board-resigning investors had stepped down last july but got around to coming together, voting to remove founder and ceo byju raveendran from the company only last friday. they are also suing him in the nclt. the trigger for all this was the rights issue which they obviously did not like, because, well, it forces them to either invest or get diluted out of the company. \[2\] any major fundraise that a company does must get its board’s approval. byju’s board has three members at the moment—byju raveendran, his wife, and his brother. the board-resigners should’ve remained on that board! maybe they could have stopped the rights issue from happening in the first place. # an opportunistic trade one story of the ongoing byju’s episode, also the story that i’ve touched upon, is that byju’s investors don’t like byju raveendran and want him out. the investors are on one side, raveendran on the other. another story though is that while all this is happening, byju’s seems to have successfully received a [commitment of $200 million]( from existing investors. from existing investors! so maybe a more accurate framing of the ongoing episode is that some investors are on one side, and raveendran and some other investors on the other. these other investors want to give him more money. byju raveendran and his family own around [26%]( of byju’s. they’re going to invest in the rights issue (of course). the board-resigners own about [30%]( they’re not going to invest in the rights issue (probably). that leaves about 45% of the holding with shareholders who we have no idea about. \[3\] the way a rights issue works is that investors get a right to buy shares proportionate to their holding. but if certain investors choose not to exercise that right, then other investors can buy shares more than they would have been able to otherwise. if the board-resigning investors who own 30% aren’t going to invest, then the mysterious 45% investors can chip in extra in their place. but why would any investor want to give the company any more money? of course, one reason is always that there is an element of sunk cost. when byju’s raised $250 million in 2022, that’s exactly [what i’d written]( the investors had already given byju’s too much money and the stakes were too high to back out then. but there’s more this time around. this particular instance the valuation is so low that the investors who choose not to invest lose everything. conversely, the investors who do invest stand to get a lot more bang for their buck. here’s what the numbers roughly look like: 1. byju’s is raising $200 million and its post-money valuation will be $225 million. \[4\] 2. raveendran & family own 26%. so they’ll have to put in about $50 million (26% of $200m). 3. this leaves $150 million. a large chunk of shareholders (including the board-resigning investors but surely there would be more) would not exercise their rights and would not invest. so the investors that do invest, would have to chip in this $150m. 4. but for this $150 million, they will get 66% of the company. (going by the company’s $225m valuation.) \[5\] so, sure, there is a large chunk of investors who desperately want to boot out raveendran and stall this rights issue. but there is also a chunk of investors (or at least *an* investor) who is looking forward to the large investors sitting out of the rights issue so that they stand the chance to grab a majority stake in the company. byju’s is fighting its board-resigning investors in two courts at the moment. in the [karnataka high court]( to get its investors’ meeting and vote to remove raveendran from the company invalidated. and in the nclt, where the investors filed the suit to get byju’s rights issue invalidated. i don’t know how this is going to end but i do know that the end date of the rights issue is in two days and no court is this fast. it’s unlikely either court decides in time. so probably the rights issue will happen and the investors who don’t invest get booted out automatically? the funniest outcome would be if the rights issue goes through anyway and the board-resigning investors invest more money even while fighting the company in court. because the sunk cost is too huge to ignore. &#x200b; **footnotes** \[1\] indian companies, even the ones that aren’t listed, have to file their financials with the ministry of corporate affairs annually. the timeline isn’t as strict as it is for listed companies, and a lot of companies really skimp out on it, but not usually the prominent ones. \[2\] here’s how to think about this. byju’s is a pie of a certain size. the company first massively reduces the size of this pie. so whatever portion of the pie you owned becomes close to nothing. now, byju’s wants to increase the size of this pie again. but this is a fresh pie. if you buy a piece, you’re part of the new pie. if you don’t, you end up holding the minuscule piece of the old pie. in other words, you’re diluted out. \[3\] some reports, including the techcrunch one i linked to earlier in the post, say that 60% of byju’s shareholders voted to remove byju raveendran. raveendran himself [says]( that this figure would have been closer to 45%. the true figure could be anywhere in-between, leaving 15–30% of smaller investors who aren’t accounted for. \[4\] if a company’s worth $100 but someone gives it $500, the company’s pre-money valuation was $100 but post-money valuation is $600. because that cash is worth something. \[5\] the true figure would be this 66% + a part of their earlier stake which would be small and negligible. &#x200b; *original source:* [* ","A detailed post analyzes the financial turmoil at EdTech giant Byju's, focusing on the conflict between investors and founder Byju Raveendran.

the options (and the results) are given below. statement | % ---|--- india belongs to citizens of all religions equally, not just hindus | 79 india belongs only to hindus | 11 no opinion | 10 the survey question and the options that were provided are too restrictive. they don't capture bjp's hindutva ideology. i have interacted with several hardcore bjp supporters. here is their belief system: * congress prioritised muslim interests over hindu interests. * an example - the haj subsidy (now discontinued) is an example of ""minority appeasement"", but the subsidies for kailash mansarovar yatra are perfectly fine. both of these were started by the congress government, but the very fact that they started a scheme that supports muslims makes them anti-hindu. these people also strongly believe that india belongs to all religions, but their definition of equality is different. they want a state which caters to hinduism (and hindu interests), but does not do so for other faiths (especially islam and christianity). they don't want other religions to leave india, but they want them to live in a country where the majority should dictate their laws. this survey is therefore restrictive. i would instead look at the following survey which offers a better picture of religious tolerance in india: this survey highlights how while the majority of indians claims they respect each other's faiths, they neither want to live with other faiths and nor do they want to marry into other faiths. the survey also highlights how the majority of indians feel that being hindu is very important to being indian. it is these emotions the bjp has tapped into. how much do people lie in such surveys to sound politically correct? i mean people will say what they think sounds good. but i don't think 80% indians believe in religious equality. people like modi would be at the level of owaisi in our politics if that was the case. excerpt from the article: >this remarkable support for religious pluralism shows that religious tolerance continues to be a defining element of the social fabric. >it is natural for religious minorities to lay emphasis on religious pluralism. but the view that india belongs to followers of all religions is also held by members of the majority religion. nearly eight in every 10 hindus said that they have faith in religious pluralism. only 11% of hindus said that they think that india is nation of hindus. >what is more reassuring is that more more young people (81%) than old (73%) were inclined to put premium on religious pluralism. although the support for religious tolerance is high across the social spectrum, educational qualifications makes a difference. compared with 72% of those who were unschooled, 83% of highly educated people said that they were in favour of equal status of all religions. >while communal tensions/conflicts are typically seen as an urban phenomenon, the data show a different pattern. as opposed to a commonly held belief, people living in urban settings appeared to be more supportive of religious pluralism and tolerance than those residing in the countryside. >in sum, a high degree of support for religious pluralism and equality at the societal level points to a couple of things. first, contrary to emerging perceptions, the idea of religious coexistence and tolerance holds its ground firmly. second, a sharp religious divide in the political realm may not necessarily reflect the situation in the wider society. one, therefore, needs to see how religion features in the electoral context and in everyday life separately. thanks, that was an interesting read. i also agree that this research provides a clearer view than csds. here are some points that caught my attention: - the vast majority of indians say they are very free today to practice their religion (91%), and all of india’s major religious groups share this sentiment: roughly nine-in-ten buddhists (93%), hindus (91%), muslims (89%) and christians (89%) say they are very free to practice their religion, as do 85% of jains and 82% of sikhs. - among hindus, a majority of those who have a favorable opinion of the ruling bharatiya janata party (bjp) say religious diversity benefits the country (57%), compared with 45% among those who have an unfavorable opinion of the bjp. - roughly one-in-five muslims (21%) and 17% of hindus say that in the last 12 months they themselves have faced discrimination because of their religion, as do 18% of sikhs. by contrast, christians are less likely to say they have felt discriminated against because of their religion (10%), and similar shares of buddhists and jains (13% each) fall into this category. one more thing: this research was down between 2019-20. a lot has changed since....","A CSDS-Lokniti pre-poll survey reveals 79% of respondents believe India belongs to all religions equally. Users in the comments debate the validity of this finding, with some arguing that while people claim to support pluralism, their voting behavior and support for 'Hindutva' politics contradict this. The discussion explores the nuance between abstract support for equality and the desire for majoritarian dominance in law and culture, questioning if respondents lie to sound politically correct.","['CSDS-Lokniti survey: 79% say India belongs to all religions equally', 'User critiques: Survey questions may not capture the nuance of Hindutva support', 'Debate: People support pluralism but want majority dictating laws', 'Discrepancy between stated beliefs and voting for polarization', 'Observation that urban areas are surprisingly more supportive of pluralism']",Social Issues

1c9c2en,"does the eci have one set of model code of conduct requirements for senior bjp star campaigners and another set for others? | eas sarma, former secretary to the goi writes to election commission to shri rajiv kumar, chief election commissioner shri gyanesh kumar, election commissioner dr sukhbir singh sandhu, election commissioner dear dr sukhbir singh sandhu, s/shri gyanesh kumar/ rajiv kumar, i am sure that the election commission, which claims to be ever vigilant and fully committed to enforcing the model code of conduct (mcc), is fully aware that the government recently notified far-reaching relaxations in fdi in the space sector, blatantly violating the mcc requirement ( strangely, coinciding with a scheduled meeting of elon musk with the prime minister (pm), perhaps to please him, the union cabinet had an emergency meeting to announce the above-cited policy in an indecent haste. had the commission cared to issue a notice to the government and called for its explanation, the commission and the public would have come to know of the circumstances that compelled the government to take such a hasty, inappropriate decision at a time when elections are being held. while the bjp-led nda government may have ostensibly cited the “national interest” as usual to justify its transgression of the mcc, in reality, the decision hurts the national interest irreversibly, which the public ought to know. ironically, better discretion prevailed on elon musk to call off his scheduled meeting with the pm, while the nation has been forced to live with a decision that would haunt it for a long time. the public have witnessed how the commission acted with a great deal of promptitude against other political parties for prima facie violations of mcc, far less serious in nature (example: whereas, the same commission has been complicit in allowing the bjp, the bjp-ruled nda government to go scott free for far more serious mcc violations. evidently, the commission has one set of mcc requirements for the bjp and another for others! over the last few days, i addressed the commission several times, to act against the statements reported to have been made by the pm, distorting the statements made by leaders of other political parties and openly invoking religion to appeal for votes. for example, my letters referring to the pm’s statement in tamil nadu ( and his speech in assam ( pointed to instances on which, if an an investigation initiated by the commission had shown that his statements did violate the mcc and amounted to using religion for votes, they would have attracted not only penal action for mcc violation but also penal action under section 123 of the representation of people act (rpa) under which it would amount to a “corrupt practice” attracting the liability of deterrent penalties ( more recently, the bjp announced a “mega rally of hindu saints” to be organised at the igi stadium, on which i once again addressed you to act urgently but you chose not to act (t encouraged by the election commission’s silence and perhaps even willing endorsement, the bjp has since gone one step farther, openly using a religious symbol in its communications appealing for votes ( on which i requested you to take firm action ( as usual, you have chosen not to act against it. the commission has chosen to remain silent and inactive on each and every one of my complaints. in fact, every instance of inaction on the part of the commission encouraged the bjp and its leaders to commit more and more violations in respect of both the mcc and section 123 of the rpa, making a mockery of the very existence of the commission as a “constitutional authority”. time and again, i pointed out to you the “reservoir of authority” you have under article 324 and how you could have come down heavily on all parties violating the mcc equitably, how you could have ordered the central investigation/ enforcement agencies to function under your oversight during elections to prevent partisan action against the opposition, how you could have directed the nda government to recall the bjp representatives from the boards of bharat electronics ltd (bel), electronics corporation of india ltd (ecil) and the sbi to impart credibility to those three cpses in so far as they are concerned with elections and how you could have frozen the unspent amounts from illegal electoral bond donations lying with the bjp and others. the fact that you have chosen not to invoke your legitimate authority against the bjp and the bjp-led nda government has given the public an impression that you are no more than a body subordinate to the political executive, afraid of senior leaders of the bjp, unable to act against that party and ineffective in functioning as an independent statutory regulator of the electoral process whose primary objective should be to ensure that elections are conducted in a free and fair manner. many of your predecessors, though selected in the same manner as in your case, chose to remain apolitical, independent and effective, gaining public trust and credibility. i am afraid that the numerous instances of inaction on your part during the last few days set you apart from them. i suggest that each one of you individually and the three of you collectively ponder over what i have said above and the concerns i raised in my previous correspondence, attempt a self-evaluation of your role vis-a-vis the mandate of article 324, whether you could come upto the expectations of the public and the expectations of all political parties, whether the numerous instances of your inaction make you an abettor of violations of the mcc and a party to infringement of section 123 of the rpa and whether you can call yourself without hesitation an independent, apolitical constitutional authority. as citizens, we can at best appeal to your conscience but your action/ inaction will determine your credibility as a constitutional authority. all the best, yours sincerely, e a s sarma, former secretary to the government of india visakhapatnam ","Former bureaucrat EAS Sarma writes an open letter to the Election Commission, asking if there are different MCC requirements for BJP star campaigners versus others.

1cjwihn,"why is no one talking about this? in amit shah's gandhinagar seat, 16 candidates have withdrawn from the election race. why would they do this if as they claim, their work has been so gooood? chandigarh to surat to indore and now this. public doesn’t seem to care so neither do they :) democracy and free and fair elections? anyone? now some typical bjp bhakts will do whataboutery and say what about emergency, what about booth capturing in pre-2000 era etc etc amazing how people are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure. no whataboutism please, all these things (minus infra) were far better in were far better in upa era. even if for a moment we give the benefit of doubt to those who support bjp and accept their argument or stance, **whats the guarantee that bjp would continue infrastructure push when they become authoritarian?** and infra doesn’t mean only roads, airports, ports. it also means clean air, environment, accessible spaces, smart cities (remember?) , etc and this infrastructure image that bjp has has its own fair share of corruption so bjp supporters cannot claim they are clean (all are equally dirty in corruption, none spared) , and has its own quality problems, toll prices problems, monopolisation problems. so the reason why bjp came to power in 2014 was riding the india against corruption movement.. now that differentiating factor of non corrupt vs corrupt has vanished.. whats left? and something as recent as electoral bonds, washing machine to reinforce this point. even if you assume both congress and bjp are equally corrupt and deliver equal economic performance, congress atleast has better social fabric and democratic values. see their manifesto if you haven’t. >*i created a whole pdf document comparing both the manifestos topic wise in a side by side tabular manner so that it makes it easier and faster to make informed decisions for the benefit of all and it has the exact same words and lines from each manifestos and nothing is changed or deleted/missed.* >**here is the google docs document :** [**manifesto proposals - a side-by-side comparison**]( >*and here is the* >[**pdf version of the document**]( >*read time of the entire document : 30 minutes* economy? most of the economic growth is because of the govt spending and we all see the joblessness and unemployment rates..if govt is really doing good then they should be talking about jobs and employment in the election rallies and propaganda… but there are commendable positives like startups, digital economy do you think if this govt had created enough jobs during its tenure, they wouldn’t have made a huge campaign and drumbeating about it? this govt celebrates even the smallest of things like the biggest of things … what about religious hatred that is being spread and whats the point of all the wealth or infrastructure if you dont have social harmony in the country and have riots like scenario? whats the point of all the development when you dont have basic freedoms to eat wear love marry according to your choice.. like many have pointed out, the trajectory this govt is on would end up being a banana republic like china with dystopian human rights and liberties minus the infrastructure that china enjoys. (*this is the best they can do at their best, assuming no corruption, rapid industrialisation, infrastructure, which is unrealistic, so we would end up with worst human rights and mediocre infrastructure*) if democracy is intact and breathing incompetence and flaws of govt can be exposed and made accountable, once you become authoritarian, what can anyone do even if you don’t do any infrastructure development? even if you ignore allllllll these things just answer this question: **if the modi govt is doing sooooo good (whatever this good means to you) then why do they need to demolish democracy? wont they be re-elected anyways if they did such an amazing work that you some of you believe? rig elections in broad daylight, jail opponents, break parties, suppress freedom, suppress and control media, do all these nonsense religious hatred, pass bills without discussion debate, use money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, suspend opposition mps enmasse etc whats the need for all of this? their idea of election winning is saam, daam, danda, bhed, and this is what they are doing. it’s gujarat, they’ll keep voting bjp until the heat death of the universe, no matter what. everyone in gujarat knows haren pandya and justice lodhas story.....we are all just pretending to act normal newslaundry and the news minute posted a video about this they have to win under any circumstance.even if there is .0000001% chance that they will loose. they cannot take it.they have done too much illegal stuff which will get exposed if they are not in power...they just cannot afford to loose, it's a matter of their survival...","A user highlights that 16 candidates withdrew from the election race in Amit Shah's Gandhinagar seat, questioning the fairness of the process.

1ck1eo0,"it seems like bjp is struggling to hold its traditional voters. since bjp started its hindu-muslim rhetoric in full force, its a very good reason to believe that bjp is feeling that even its traditional voters are not happy, and they have to pull them together. every election has three type of voters. 1. pro bjp voters 2. anti bjp voters 3. swing voters generally, no party appeal to their traditional voters in elections, as they will vote to them anyway, they have no choice. they appeal to swing voters who change their votes every election (as any sane voter should do). they are the kingmakers. that's why, in the past two elections, the bjp limited their election campaign to development and non-communal issues. this election is the first time they are openly going communal. they know development plank in not going to work on swing voters as they have been fooled two times in the row. they know even their traditional voters, who love to hate muslims, are reconsidering voting to bjp. hence, it is important for them to save their traditional votes. that's why we are listening this much of hindu-muslim from pm speeches. in other elections, it is just sprinkled here and there, not the main focus of election campaign, as communal speeches dissuade swing voters who vote on issues mainly. one of my cousin who is pro-bjp is emotionally blackmailing in family group by saying, who will provide better future to <insert name of nice/nephew>. so anytime anyone opposes muddi, he will reply to them asking this shit. he is getting toxic day by day. a lot of urban pro bjp voters are planning to stay home because they’re so convinced by the 400 tag line two big flaws in your analysis: 1. your point of parties not appealing to their core voter base is blatantly untrue. that's literally the first thing any party does. and bjp's traditional voters are currently the ones with the most fervor in the indian political scene, to the point of becoming ""andhbhakts."" 2. swing voters outside of urban liberal circles are overwhelming voting for bjp in all the bjp stronghold states, citing lack of good pm face from opposition and half-delivered welfare schemes. bjp going communal is them doing course-correction after the unfavorable voting in phase 1. they are riling up their hindutva-focused voters to make up for the low voting percentages, as the people skipping voting are often the swing voters. there is a reason south and north east voted first. now bjp can go unhinged in hindi heartlands so it would then work in their favour, no? mission accomplished then.","A user analyzes that the BJP's shift to intense Hindu-Muslim rhetoric suggests they are struggling to hold traditional voters and need to consolidate their base.

and does that even happen in a rigid society where there was absolutely no improvement in education, awareness, or quality of opposition? &nbsp; second type who spread these news are centrist / centre-right columnists and editors with hindutva sympathies who are essentially running a psychological gaslighting long con. they create an emotional state of false hope in the liberal groups, and an emotional state of fear in the rightwing groups. then wait for counting day in anticipation. on counting day evening, when bjp's victory is inevitably announced, they can then pull the rug of hope from under liberal feet and delight both themselves and their rightwing fans. after that, in a week-long orgy of gloating, they'll publish article after article suggesting how and why ""liberals must introspect."" tavleen singh is probably already working on this right now. the gloating bjp sm warriors will pass around these articles, including here on reddit, along with copious use of the word ""burnol"" in their comments. i suspect these psych campaigns are bjp-sponsored at the very least, may be even state-sponsored. &nbsp; so i'd suggest not believing optimistic takes and tropes. the observation is easy to make: do you see any signs of ""enlightenment"" in the masses around you? i certainly don't. a society, especially a religious conservative immature one like ours, doesn't magically enlighten itself within 5-6 months, that too in the absence of any compelling person or group working to actively bring such an improvement. it won't magically leap from misinformation and hate to ethics and acceptance within months. imo, there's no convertible anger against modi whatsoever. he'll win comfortable majority, maybe even cross the 350 mark by himself. just prepare yourself mentally for it. thank you for this post. this is the reality check a few of us need. with the entire state machinery at their disposal, and openly employed in a partisan manner, it will take nothing short of a miracle to stop modi. don't look at op-eds, or clipped videos doing the rounds on twitter. don't look at analysis which try to infer polling results from polling percentages. for al their bias, opinion polls by agencies will still give you a better prediction of the poll results. each and every recent opinion poll is predicting 350+ seats for nda. the best that india can hope for is that bjp does not cross 273 on its own. anything else is not happening. great write-up. the overly optimistic takes that i have been seeing everywhere baffles me. it's like, there's no connection to on-ground reality with these people. reminds me of pre-2019 results times like you said, just with more vigor. bjp is a party which is nimble. they can easily make course correction. they do mistake time to time in misjudging the people pulse but they can learn from the mistake. plus it is easy for them to remobilise their troops according to the need. the narrative that bjp somehow misjudged the people pulse and abki bar 400 par will kill them is nothing but a day dream. yes, bjp did make a mistake in 400+ campaign but they have now corrected. they are now playing the fear factor card. so the feeling that bjp is overconfident and is blindly going towards defeat is not correct. this election and narrative reminds me of the war of ukraine. people mock the stupidity of russia and if you go to world news sub, you will feel that overconfident and stupid russia will be defeated by ukraine. but russia is quite nimble and make course correction as needed. being a behemoth that can mobilise as and when need edge. that is why it is very difficult to defeat russia. similar thing is here also. we can mock the stupidity of their leaders and day dream about overconfident and blind manoeuvre of bjp, but reality is different. >liberal / left / progressive types who don't understand the average hindu mindset and aren't ready to admit that hindutva understands that shitty mindset perfectly. its this patronizing mindset of the ""liberals"" that the average hindu mindset is ""shitty"" . this is precisely what alienates the average hindu from the left. the need for introspection into this is a priority that the actual indian liberals can not ignore anymore. tum log majority hindu ho yar. jab tak koi muslim sikh , kisan dalit ko peet that rahega tum cote karoge… tumhe is me maza ata hai.. aise hi thodi na modi ji ultra god bane hai","A detailed post warns against 'false election tropes' like 'Modi is nervous' or 'poor turnout hurting BJP', drawing parallels to incorrect predictions in 2019.

1ddasw5,"those blaming people of ayodhya for election result showing 'foolishness': ram mandir chief priest there are two main reasons for the ayodhya results i could gather: 1) the mandir and its inauguration was completed in january. gave enough time for people to celebrate and rejoice. in the months that followed, came the real issues of price rise, danger to the constitution etc. had they timed the inauguration in march timeframe, it would’ve been fresh in the minds of people. 2) this is a big one. the demolitions of properties and negligent recompensation or relocation really hurt people on the ground. plus the hotels that are constructed around the temple belong to people from one state majorly. no prizes for guessing which one. there could be many more, but, these are ones most talked about in alternate media by journalists. feel free to pitch in. there are lots of issues that are just not getting highlighted at all. * the bureaucracy here has caused a lot of pains to residents, especially on fair and timely compensation of demolition of homes. * rampant construction is not just inconvenient but brainless as well, it has not benefited anybody in the city. * a lot of livelihoods were affected due to demolition of buildings, new shops which were months old, homes decades old sheltering generations. many families uprooted overnight. a relative of mine whose home was demolished partially also had his clinic demolished. now sewer line is being planned in front of his home. he has not been able to open his clinic for six months now. that home housed 4 generations of ayodhya residents. the entire extended family has not voted for bjp as a result. he joined rss a couple of years ago btw. met him today, he was happy bjp lost here. * similarly, almost 20000 homes, at least 3 voters in each home, do the math. * no selection and support to local economy in construction of the temple or city. all contractors and companies are from you know which state. it not like we don't have competent builders, but you know how these things work. only daily wage laborers were hired locally. * people here were expecting new wave of employment and business opportunities for the locals, but no such thing materialized. graduates are working as rickshaw drivers and waiters. any new opportunity which arose was all auctioned, so naturally was pocketed by the rich. * lallu singh was disliked by many, and was complacent af. he was riding on modi's coattails. allegedly yogi's recommendations were dismissed by shah, which somehow resulted in the ground force not working as hard. amidst all this, there is no recourse for the people suffering. * a lot of people were sure of bjp's win and vocal about it, but there was a silent sentiment that bjp will win but they don't deserve votes. many folks publicly praise modi but voted for the opposition. * massive scams in sale and purchase of land here, many people lost their life savings. we were also planning to buy some lands near the temple but my dad could not make up his mind at the time, thankfully. i would also like to clarify a few points i see being parroted all over social media. * homes were not illegally built or on unauthorised lands, but when roads were being built and lanes added, the government claimed the land. many people virtually lost their entire home and shops without proper and timely compensation. * a lot of homes are decades old, were built on nazool lands, and thus lacked proper paperwork. when the villages here were first established a lot of land was allotted vocally. now their grandsons and great-grandsons did not bother to get it rectified. however, i believe the government should have respected their residence regardless. * ayodhya bashing and boycotting is having the opposite affect here. ayodhya is not a tourist economy yet, we are transitioning. we weren't entirely tourism dependent before, won't be any longer if truly boycotted. we have survived worse. people have never really cared for my city ever, it was always a political currency. bjp lost so the right is bashing. before this the left was bashing us that people deserved their suffering because we voted for bjp. people failed to understand that ground issues should not be neglected, and bjp was milking the good faith of people so far. they could have at least hired a better architect for the temple.. just sayin a priest commenting on democracy. nice. i think ram mandir is not a big deal when it is in your city, esp if it is not generating jobs/revenue. people outside ayodhya are more invested in it.","The Chief Priest of Ram Mandir blames the 'foolishness' of officials, specifically regarding demolition compensation, for the election loss in Ayodhya.

1cnz3z5,"how india’s navy changed tack | after decades of shunning alliances, new delhi is rethinking how to project power on the high seas india should start being involved in regional problems more often. especially, afghan and east africa. se asia and india have the same problem. (article) --- india, a rising military power that proudly shuns alliances, last month deployed a frigate to the arabian sea and demonstrated just how much its view of the world is changing. with little fanfare, and after decades of touting india’s “strategic autonomy”, new delhi sent the ins talwar on a mission to provide direct support to a us-led maritime coalition. the frigate’s main role was helping to intercept a drug-running dhow trafficking nearly a kiloton of methamphetamines, hashish and heroin in the arabian sea — working in a task force of the bahrain-headquartered combined maritime forces. but far from being a routine drug bust, this marked a strategic sea change for a country that until now has only joined international military missions under the un flag. “india has quietly, formally, entered a coalition,” said one western official in new delhi. “they haven’t been sounding the megaphone and we are not trying to overly publicise this and spook the herd, but it’s a significant moment.” the operation came as india is aligning more closely with the us on military and economic matters, in large part because of shared concerns about china. there are naturally still limits to co-operation. india declined to join operation prosperity guardian, the us-led coalition formed last year to fend off attacks by yemen-based houthis in the red sea. but since november it has been working with the 43-nation cmf, which polices the high seas along some of the world’s main shipping lanes in the western indian ocean and is under the command of the us fifth fleet. india’s navy — acting independently — has also been increasing patrols in the high seas around the red sea in recent months, escorting ships at a time of war, and in a few cases rescuing crews from pirate attack. india has skin in this game: it supplies many of the sailors on the world’s merchant vessels, 17 of whom were temporarily taken captive last month near the strait of hormuz by iranian troops. “the fact that we are part of the cmf is not just a statement of india’s closeness to the us, but also a statement of our own interest,” said indrani bagchi of the ananta aspen centre, a new delhi think-tank. “our interest is not only to put our flag out there, but to make our statement that we are a net security provider in this region.” india’s diplomatic and military independence is a cornerstone of its foreign policy, but a tilt towards the west has been long in coming. jawaharlal nehru was among the founders of the non-aligned movement in 1961. india’s scepticism of the west has a firm foundation from the cold war, when it was rankled by washington’s arming of pakistan — an ongoing irritant — and found the soviet union (more recently russia) a more reliable friend. but indian officials and analysts say china is now india’s foremost strategic threat, not pakistan. so while modi government officials continue to disavow the word “alliance”, new delhi does have burgeoning defence and technology partnerships with countries such as the us, france and israel. india has also been retooling its military and redeployed some of the troops it had along the pakistan border to its long, disputed frontier with china after deadly clashes there in 2020. while analysts say the northern border is the indian military’s rightful focus, india is also taking steps to upgrade its navy and assert its presence at sea. its highest-profile effort in this area is membership in the so-called quad, where security issues are co-ordinated with the us, australia and japan. india and france have also carried out joint naval patrols from the french overseas territory réunion. india and the seychelles held joint military exercises in march. “growing chinese presence in the indian ocean is a canker for us presence and objectives, and a canker for everybody else, and a canker for india, given the lack of transparency in china’s motives and intentions,” said sujan chinoy of the manohar parrikar institute for defence studies and analyses. india is projecting soft power in the broader indian ocean basin, too — a task helped by the presence of diaspora populations across the region. iit madras, the southernmost of india’s network of elite technology universities, recently chose zanzibar as the site of its first overseas campus. but india’s overtures to its island neighbours have been snubbed in some cases. the maldives, which alternates between pro-india and pro-china politicians in power, is in the process of replacing a small contingent of indian troops there with civilian officials after mohamed muizzu won the presidency last year on an “india out” platform. for india, this is likely to be a long game.","An article analysis discusses how India's Navy is changing track by joining a US-led maritime coalition in the Red Sea, signaling a shift from its traditional non-aligned stance.

1cqcphm,"bad ruling party, failed opposition many people are not happy with the current government so, they are voting for the opposition alliance. while ""not being in agreement with the current government"" is a valid reason to vote for the opposition it should not be the only argument. we should vote someone that satisfies our individual demands and also takes important national commitments in consideration. now, we as a nation have failed in building an opposition. in all these years we could not find a better face than raga. let's ignore raga for a moment, even if congress forms govt. it will be coalition government. now, every party has different ideologies so, they will clash often, creating instability. every decision will take longer duration. it should satisfy all the parties (even if it is harmful for the nation to consider certain conditions of some party). example: let the govt. agrees to south states that center will contribute to the states according to their share of gst, then, bihar will protest, because they will not get any funds. it is harmful for the nation also, because rich states will become richer and poor states will become poorer. we failed to question the opposition - 1. was there no-one better than raga in these ten years? and why everytime raga? 2. how realistic their promises are - 1lakh to every woman and unemployed youth, msp on every crop (it's not possible considering india's current gdp), 50% increase in reservation?? 3. like bjp congress have leaders who have given hate speeches in the past. what will the party do about them? again, we have failed to build a better opposition and now we have no choice (aage kuwa, piche khai) single party governments being better than coalition government is a myth in india. narasimha rao, vajpayee and manmohan singh all led governments where the ruling party did not have majority by itself. (244, 182, 145, 206 respectively). and these governments proved to be great for india. liberalization, nuclear test, indo-us relationship, indo-pak peace efforts, right to education, highest gdp growth rate, mnrega, nrhm, indo-us nuclear agreement. a coalition ensures adequate discussions and due diligence before passing bills. some might argue that it's a slow process but the alternative has not been very successful. recently we have seen multiple bills passed aggressively and then rolled back after protests, that whole process has undoubtedly been more chaotic, expensive and time consuming than the time that might be required to reach an agreement between coalition. if you aren't voting for opposition you are in favour of status quo ie bjp rule. yeah. raga has matured way too much from before. frankly speaking. he’s confident and more real than mowgli ji oops, i saw the username opposition hasn't failed. you're just plugging bjp/rss, though you indirectly admit that modi was a bad pm & hindutva guys can't govern a country as diverse as india successfully.","A user post titled 'Bad ruling party, failed opposition' argues that while the current government is disliked, the opposition (led by Rahul Gandhi) is not a viable alternative due to instability and unrealistic promises (1 lakh to women).

1d8jy3c,"who's becoming new pm ? now, that nda has some 293 seats india has some 234 seats and 16 for other parties. who's forming government ? let me first tell you that we're in for long unstable government i think atleast for an decade. now, the logic says nda is forming the government however it's not as simple as it sounds, since nitish and naidu hold for some 28 seats. nitish, naidu and modi all them have even chances of becoming a pm at this point. all of them are og politicians so they understand that this will be once in a life time opportunity to become pm. nitish has been offered deputy pm from india so it's natural he'll need better offer from nda to continue. but will nda even agree on this probably or probably not! naidu has won election with majority in andhra so he also doesn't need the support from bjp for state elections as well. plus he was the one saying anyone but modi for pm for long time. although he has been long term loyal partner of bjp since vajpayee there is still chance. let's say both stay on the side of nda for now but even that won't make things easier since now every single seat is crucial every bjp members like nitin gadkari, rajnath has the opportunity to become the pm if nitish and naidu back someone from og members that will be tough for modi to come again. modi although won't settle for less than pm but if nda make modi pm they'll risk the next elections into risk since modi will not be allowed to run for pm next elections for sure. and to win next elections rss will need to do alot of reformations in branding, ideological shift also will happen, and they'll need to prepare the next face of bjp but since modi will be pm of india i don't think he'll let any other face shine other than him since we all know he's the most egoistic creature on earth. which will make it harder for that new face to win directly in next elections so it will be also crucial for rss to let someone new take up now and make a strong point for next elections. now, for new pm as well it will be harder to run the country since opposition will be in the picture for everything they do and next decade will be full of andolans and media being more on neutral side. this way opposition will become stronger but not by alot and nda will be weaker but not by a lot as well. also, there is chances of india alliance breaking but they'll also understand that they don't hold any value as individual parties when bjp is there. there won't be a single party which can challange the bjp directly if they break up so we might see them for atleast this term ( few partners might leave but few will join as well) so till next elections i think we can see bjp coming to some 200-210 mark and congress coming up the ladder to 120-130 mark. which might lead to another term of unstable government. also, there is chance bjp buys out mps from india. there is also a chance the mps from bjp go to india since many of them came thinking easy wins due to face of modi hut that will not be case next elections. so will see lots of trading as well conclusion: nda forming government good chance that new face becomes pm and not modi and high chance of new government mid term as well. things i read on twitter: - naidu demanded for amit shah to leave home ministry - rss looking for new leader options and gadkari leading the talks - yogi or rss being major reason behind up loss. i am not expert so share your thoughts !! congress had less seats in both the upa govt and they were stable enough to complete whole 10 year period . so ..... >new pm hope not kangana haha, until 2014 a government backed by around 293 mps would have been considered relatively stable. let's not even think about such disgusting situations deputy pm from india has no power. it is ceremonial.","A speculative discussion on who will become the next PM given NDA's 293 seats and reliance on allies like Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu.

1ebmc2w,"2024 budget & digital rights: data protection board & indiaai mission get fresh allocation; funds for long-established schemes see reductions | internet freedom foundation # tl;dr the union budget for 2024-2025 reveals an overall increase in funds allocation for meity, mha, mib, and dot as compared to 2023-2024. the budget allocated to meity has witnessed the highest increase among these ministries – 32.56% over last year's – yet-to-be-formed data protection board and the indiaai mission gets funding for the first time however, rural digital literacy scheme pmgdisha gets no funding (for the second year in a row). although dot cut funding for usof by \~80% as compared to 2023-2024 budget, it increased funding for bharatnet by 70%. while the overall increase in budgetary allocations compared to last year may paint a positive picture, on deeper analysis we realise that the decline in fund allocation towards long-established schemes and projects as well as underutilisation of funds continue to be unaddressed issues and thus a cause of contention. # important documents 1. iff’s post on union budget for 2023-2024 ([\~link\~]( 2. iff’s posts on the interim union budget for 2024-2025 ([\~link\~]( 3. consolidated budgetary data for selected items ([\~link\~]( # introduction in the final session of the 17th ls term, union finance minister, shrimati nirmala sitharaman, presented the union interim budget for the financial year (“**fy**”) 2024-2025. in the ongoing monsoon session, the union finance minister placed a new budget for the fy2024-2024 in both houses on july 23, 2024. the budgeted estimates (“**be**”) for the ministry of electronics and information technology (“**meity**”), ministry of home affairs (“**mha**”), ministry of information and broadcasting (“**mib**”), and department of telecommunications (“**dot**”) witnessed an overall increase of 15.98% in the 2024-25 union budget compared to 2023-2024 be. the budget allocated to meity has witnessed the highest increase (32.56%) among these ministries in comparison to the previous budget (2023-2024) and dot witnessed the second highest (14.7%). the budget for mha and mib got a 9.44% and 7.45% increase respectively. the increase in the be for this fiscal year from the revised estimates (“**re**”) of the previous year was also the highest for meity (52.11%). while dot and mha saw an increase of 13.79% and 9.44% respectively, mib witnessed a decrease of 2.41% since the re of 2023-2024. table 1: total expenditure for meity, mib, dot, and mha (in rs. crores) digital public infrastructure (“**dpi**”) was an area of focus for the government during the presentation of the union budget including the varying schemes aimed at farmers with the digital crop survey, agri-stack, and also the service sector with a proposal for the development of more dpi apps for businesses. however, it appears that dpi(s) found limited specific budgetary allocation even after being a point of focus in the economic survey released a day before the budget 2024-25. dpis have been attributed for the rise in technological engagement of indian citizens with more ministries introducing population-scale interactive technological platforms which are being clubbed under the common banner of dpi. we will soon release a detailed analysis of the economic survey 2023-2024 and the over-reliance on technology-centred tools such as ai and dpi within it. # the ministry of electronics and information technology the total budgetary allocation for meity in the budget for 2024-2025 is ₹21936.9 cr, which is a 32.57% increase from the previous financial year’s budget (be 2023-2024). the increase is even higher when compared to the re of 2023-2024, i.e., a year-on-year change of 52.11%. this is in contrast to the budgetary trends we witnessed in 2021, 2022 and 2023, where there was underutilisation of the budget. we appreciate the large overall increase in budgetary allocation to meity in fy 2024-2025 and hope to see these funds be directed towards infrastructure development aimed at increasing telecom and broadband connectivity, research and deep deliberation into emerging technologies, strengthening of citizen-centric fora and systems, and closing the digital divide. table 2: budgetary allocations for specific items for meity the most notable change in the budget for 2024-2025, which has direct implications for digital rights, has to be the allocation of ₹2 cr for the data protection board (“**dpb**”). after a long and arduous journey for data protection legislation, it is disappointing to see funding of a mere ₹2 cr for a regulatory body whose functioning will have a direct impact on the implementation of the digital personal data protection act (“**dpdpa**”), 2023, successful or otherwise. of this ₹2 crore, only ₹4 lahks is [\~reportedly\~]( allocated for capital expenditure, which includes fixed assets such as the digital portal, and the rest (₹ 1.96 cr) is allocated for revenue expenditure (salaries, etc). since it is unclear when the dpb will become functional, it is difficult to ascertain whether the allocated budget is meant to be utilised for the entire financial year or a part of it. either way, a minuscule amount of ₹4 lakhs for capital expenditure on dpb may prove to be insufficient for upskilling and training of the dpb members. in the following budgets, we hope meity ensures that it is adequately resourced for the institutional preparation of the dpb. adequate funding for key regulatory bodies such as the dpb will contribute to its independent functioning which is necessary to keep checks and balances on the executive. allocation towards a prominent regulatory body essential for the cybersecurity health of the country, the indian computer emergency response team (“**cert-in**”) also increased by 5.78% from the previous year’s budget. on another positive note, funding allocated to ‘cyber security projects’ has seen a massive increase of 89.75% since last year. this substantial increase in allocation was much needed in the backdrop of increasing incidents of data breaches and vulnerabilities and the absence of an operational, robust, and rights-advancing data protection legislation. [\~recent\~]( grave cybersecurity incidents, like the tamil nadu police facial recognition portal breach and the telangana police network data leak, have raised concerns about the detection and response capabilities of india’s cybersecurity authorities. it is worth noting that meity utilised only ₹30.11 cr out of the allocated ₹300 cr in 2022-2023, despite persisting challenges of insufficient resources, outdated infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled professionals. we hope that the same trend of under-utilisation is not followed by the ministry this fiscal year and ahead. another introduction this year was the addition of ‘indiaai mission’ as a central sector scheme, with a notable allocation of ₹551.75 cr. this is on top of the infusion of ₹10,371.92 cr [\~approved\~]( by the previous national democratic alliance (“**nda**”) cabinet in march 2024 which is to be disbursed over a period of five years to establish the scheme including its compute capacity program. the program [\~aims\~]( to establish a 10,000 graphics processing unit infrastructure to be built with public-private partnerships. the working group appointed by the government on indiaai in its october 2023 [\~report\~]( had recommended at least 24,500 graphics processing units for infrastructural requirements. moreover, the increased focus on ai and massive budgetary allowances form cause for concern owing to the massive effects of the technology on the climate – with a single chatgpt search taking 10 times as much energy as a regular google search, according to the [\~economic survey 2023-24\~]( the survey cautioned against artificial intelligence’s impact not only on climate but also on employment opportunities amidst rising automation in industries making employees redundant. with increasing trends of techno-solutionism plaguing governance in india, increased budgetary focus on bolstering ai capabilities may result in more unnecessary technological interventions – but now with ai. disappointingly, the budget for 2023-2024 and the interim budget for 2024-2025 for meity did not allocate any funds to pradhan mantri gramin digital saksharta abhiyan (“**pmgdisha**”), breaking the trend of continuous budgetary support for the rural digital literacy scheme since its inception in 2017. pmgdisha was key to increased connectivity, telecom penetration, and digital literacy across india. allocations to the scheme touched an all-time low in 2022 since 2017, and then last year in the fy 2023-24 budget, no funds were allocated towards it. the last impact assessment study of pmgdisha was carried out by the indian institute of public administration in 2020-21. the report [\~concluded\~]( that the scheme, as a digital literacy programme, “*plays an indispensable part in not only bridging the digital gap in the country but also transforming it into a knowledge economy and society*.” the allocations made to this scheme must increase, and more importantly exist, to ensure its effective progress and robust digital literacy in the country. figure 1: budget allocation to pmgdisha (meity) the other interesting trend is the complete discontinuation of budgetary allocation towards ‘promotion of digital payments’ under meity’s budget for this year. last year, we noted that the allocation to this domain plummeted to ₹1500 cr as compared to ₹2137 cr allocated to it in the 2022-2023 re, reflecting a decline of 29.8%. in the re of 2023-2024, the allocation was further reduced to ₹584 cr and finally to 0 in the budget for 2024-2025. it is also interesting to note that revised allocations increased sharply in 2022-2023 (₹2137 cr), witnessing a jump of 968.5% as compared to the 2022-2023 be which stood at ₹200 crores. even though the allocation in 2023-2024 is higher than the 2022 be, it stood lower than the re. figure 2: budgetary allocation to ‘promotion of digital payments’ (meity) meity has introduced an item titled ‘promotion of digital transactions (excluding digital payments)’ under the digital india program, for which it has allocated ₹1.5 cr. as per meity, the objective of this scheme is to promote overall digitisation for the efficient delivery of citizen-centric services and empowerment of citizens. through this newly introduced item, meity hopes to grow the volume of digital transactions in the country. it also believes that this expenditure may have a cascading effect on the promotion of digital payments scheme including estimating and measuring digital economy of india, suggesting a measurement framework for such estimation, and providing suitable policy recommendations for boosting the size and growth of the digital economy in india by leveraging the digital technologies. interestingly, despite this new addition, the total expenditure towards the digital india program has reduced significantly and consistently since the be for 2022-2023. figure 3: share of the digital india programme in the total budgetary allocation (meity) # the ministry of home affairs the total budgetary allocation for mha is 9.44% higher than what was allocated in the be for 2023-24 and 9.44% higher than the 2023-2024 revised budget. the allocation in the budget estimates, net of receipts and recoveries, for mha is ₹6458.24 cr. the allocation for planned capital expenditure has marginally dipped as compared to both 2023-2024 be (by 10.16%) and re (by 29.39%), which is disappointing. table 3: budgetary allocations for specific items for mha additionally, we notice an interesting trend in allocations to the item ‘census, survey and statistics/ registrar general of india’. for the past few years, the estimated budget for surveys and census has been large, but the actual utilisation remains minuscule. the biggest dip was seen in 2022-23, where the budget allocated was ₹3676 cr, but only ₹513.18 cr was utilised. for be 2024-25, the allocation remains large, but it is likely to fall into the same pattern of remaining underutilised figure 4: budgetary allocation to census, survey and statistics/registrar general of india (mha) on a disappointing note, mha did not allocate any funds towards its [\~cyber and information security\~]( (“**c&is**”) division, which includes key schemes such as the cybercrime prevention against women and children scheme and the indian cybercrime coordination centre (“**i4c**”) scheme. [\~reportedly\~]( i4c didn’t get fresh funding this year because it “*ceased to exist as a union government scheme starting 1 july and began working as part of the mha*”. interestingly, other divisions of the mha such as the freedom fighters and rehabilitation division and the police division still got funding allocated to them. from a reading of the budget, it is unclear under which item, if at all, is mha allocating funds for cyber security and awareness efforts. earlier this year, i4c was [\~notified\~]( as the official agency by mha to notify law enforcement authorities, under the information technology act, 2000, about unlawful activities in the cyberspace. additionally, funding for a special wing of ""cyber commandos"", reportedly an mha project meant to tackle cyber threats along with local administration, is also missing from this year’s budget for mha, despite [\~expectations\~]( # the ministry of information and broadcasting the total budgetary allocation for mib in 2024-25 is ₹4342.55 cr, which is a 7.45% decrease from the 2023-2024 budget and a 2.41% decrease from the 2023-2024 revised budget. this cut comes after mib seemingly was able to utilise a higher budget allocation last year, which seems incongruent. interestingly, the total budgetary allocation for fy 2024-2025 is the same as the allocation under the interim budget for 2024-2025, a trend uncommon for several other ministries. table 4: budgetary allocations for specific items for mha mib’s total ae since 2014-2015 has been relatively stable, as compared to the ae of meity, mha, and dot. notably, dot has introduced funding for the establishment of the ‘bhartiya bhasha anubhag’ scheme, which is a platform meant to facilitate the translation of various languages into hindi and vice versa. # the department of telecommunications in 2024-25, dot (which operates under the ministry of communications) has been allocated ₹111915.43 cr, which is a 14.69% increase over the budget allocated in 2023-24 (₹97579.05 cr) and 13.78% over the re for 2023-24 (₹98359.41 cr). table 4: budgetary allocations for specific items for dot surprisingly, the universal services obligation fund (“usof”) took a hit in funds with only ₹2000 cr allocated to it in the 2024-25 budget (same as last year’s re), an 80.77% fall from last year’s ₹10400 cr. telecom services providers have [\~persistently\~]( urged the ministry of finance to suspend usof till the existing corpus is exhausted, and in their budget requests for 2024-25, pressed for an exemption from the service tax on “assignment of right to use natural resources” and the slashing of customs duty on telecom equipment to zero. allocation to ‘compensation to telecom service providers’ saw a 102% increase in the 2024-2025 budget (₹10100 cr) as compared to the 2023-2024 budget (₹5000 cr). this item is meant to provide for the “*creation and augmentation of telecom infrastructure and access to various telecom services to people in the rural and remote areas including operation and maintenance of village public telephones*.” as far as allocations for bharatnet are concerned, there has been a significant increase of 70% in be 2024-25 (₹8500 cr) from be 2023-24 (₹5000 cr). the grant goes towards the creation of telecom infrastructure required for providing broadband connectivity to all the gram panchayats in the country and facilitating non-discriminatory access to service providers, for provisioning of broadband services in rural areas. the sharp increase in budget is appreciated. total budgetary allocation for regulatory bodies such as the telecom regulatory authority of india (“**trai**”) and telecom disputes settlement and appellate tribunal has seen a significant dip this year (₹113 cr) as compared to the previous year (₹238.53 cr). the funding for trai has reduced by 48.68% over the past year, even though dot utilised the entire revised amount allocated in 2022-2023 for the regulatory body, which was more than the be for 2022-2023. although dot allocated ₹50,00,000 towards ‘artificial intelligence and face recognition powered solution for telecom sim subscriber verification (astr)’ in the 2023-2024 budget, it has not allocated any funding in the 2024-2025 budget. funding for the digital intelligence unit project, which is meant to investigate fraudulent activity involving telecom resources, such as unsolicited commercial communication, witnessed a drastic reduction of 61.36% in the 2024-2025 budget (₹85 cr) as compared to the previous budget (₹220 cr). dot has also allocated ₹38.76 cr for the first time for the ‘prevention of spoofed incoming international calls system – 'cior' (centralized international out roamer)’. # conclusion the 2024-25 budget leaves us with a variety of feelings, some of hope and some of disappointment. while there are some budgetary allocations made for the first time, like the dpb, indiaai mission, and ‘promotion of digital transactions’, long-established budgetary items such as the ‘promotion of digital payments’, pmgdisha, the census, i4c, and the usof either witnessed a complete discontinuation of funds or took a significant hit in the allocated funds. overall funding towards the dpb includes planned capital expenditure of only ₹4 lakhs which is inadequate to say the least. an additional cause for concern is the decrease in the ae as compared to the re, and in the re as compared to the be, for the last few years. the re indicates how much is possible for the government to extend to the concerned sector and the ae indicates how much was extended. while some variation among the three is inevitable, too much of a difference can [\~reduce\~]( the credibility of the numbers and cause uncertainty. cuts in and underutilisation of the re may also negatively affect the implementation of government schemes and projects. in light of the increasing digitisation across sectors and the increasing demand for improved digital literacy as well as access to digital services, we hope that the fund allocation in these concerned sectors continues to witness a positive trend. although we appreciate the overall increase in be this year as compared to last year, we hope to see these funds be utilised efficiently and directed towards infrastructure development aimed at increasing tele-connectivity, broadband connectivity, cybersecurity, and overall digital literacy.

1br5bht,"narendra modi’s secret weapon: india’s diaspora speaking from experience as a desi born and raised in america, modi is super popular among nris who were born in india and moved abroad like my parents. but he is generally disliked by 2nd/3rd generation desis who were born and raised abroad. not that our opinion matters much since we can’t vote but just wanted to add my two cents that the indian diasporas political views is split by generation edit: when i say “2nd gen” i don’t mean only gen z / young people. 2nd generation includes anyone whose parents came to the us. for example, my abcd cousin is 51, and his parents moved to us in 1971. he is also 2nd generation. this is a secret? since when? i thought it was public knowledge that he's extremely popular among the diaspora this government has been going about asking why the oci for his critics shouldn't be canceled.. and for those hailing his leadership, might as well come back and enjoy the shitshow firsthand.. from the article: 1/2 on a grey morning in north-west london earlier this month an enthusiastic group gathered outside a community centre to fly the indian flag—plus another one featuring the lotus flower, symbol of india’s ruling bharatiya janata party (bjp). some wore saffron scarves, a colour associated with hinduism. after staging a car rally through the neighbourhood, they reconvened outside a hindu temple. a british conservative mpaddressed the crowd, praising the government of narendra modi. the gathering, organised by the overseas friends of the bjp, the party’s diaspora arm, got little attention in the local media. but footage of it soon appeared on the websites of many indian outlets. the rally was just one of countless such events run by the overseas branches of india’s parties, as the country’s general election that starts on april 19th beckons. india’s huge diaspora is an increasingly powerful force for mobilising support at home and abroad. indian politicians court it for its financial and campaigning punch. as in india itself, the bjp has been more systematic and successful than its rivals. if mr modi wins a third term, as seems likely, he can partly thank the diaspora. indians abroad have long played a disproportionate role in politics at home, going back to india’s fight for independence. many of the anti-colonial movement’s leading lights, including jawaharlal nehru and mohandas gandhi, spent years studying in britain. trained as lawyers, they used the ideas they had absorbed to argue for freedom back home. some of the most notable post-independence prime ministers, including indira gandhi and manmohan singh, also spent long periods abroad. since then, india’s diaspora has grown in size and influence. some 18m indians who retain their nationality live abroad, according to the un. that makes them the largest diaspora in the world, followed well behind by mexicans (11.2m) and russians (10.8m). if those who have relinquished their indian passports are included, the number may exceed 32m, according to the indian government’s estimates. most indians abroad have been highly successful. in 2023 they sent home nearly $125bn in remittances, equivalent to around 3.4% of india’s gdp, according to world bank estimates. in america 80% of citizens of indian origin have college degrees. the median indian household income there is $150,000, twice america’s national average. people of indian descent lead google, the world bank—and britain. there are still plenty of low- or semi-skilled indian workers filling menial jobs the host countries’ natives will not or cannot do, especially in the gulf states. yet even there the share of white-collar professionals as a proportion of indians is growing. it now approaches 30%. especially in english-speaking countries, today’s indian diaspora has more cash and clout than earlier waves of migrants, who often started out dirt-poor. what does this mean for their role in indian politics? most indians who live outside india do not vote in indian elections, as they can vote only in person in their constituencies back home. that costs too much for most of them in time and money. only 120,000-odd are registered for this year’s poll, according to india’s election commission, and only a fraction of that modest number are expected to turn up. in a country with nearly 1bn registered voters, 18m potential votes dispersed across hundreds of electoral districts would be unlikely to make a difference. besides, plenty of diaspora indians remain immune to mr modi’s charms. a survey of indian-americans in 2020 by the carnegie endowment for international peace, an american think-tank, found that while 48% approved of mr modi, 31% disapproved and 22% strongly so. indeed, the diaspora is much less enthusiastic than indians in india, 78% of whom are said to approve of him. one reason may be that they read a wider variety of news than their relatives at home, where most media are relentlessly pro-bjp. moreover, an increasing number of migrants are from south india, where mr modi is not so popular. at least in britain, those who have recently migrated for work or education tend to be less politically strident, says pratik dattani, who runs bridge india, a non-partisan diaspora outfit in britain. for many in the diaspora, indian politics may not be their main concern, ranking behind worries about jobs, education and daily life. the real impact of the diaspora in politics is in funding, campaigning and spreading india’s influence. as overseas indians have become more prominent in their host societies, many have begun to take more of an interest in politics both in their new countries and back home. so political parties, indian and foreign, are wooing them more keenly. mr modi and his bjp are acutely aware of this. their election manifesto in 2014 called the diaspora “a vast reservoir to articulate the national interests and affairs globally” that would be “harnessed for strengthening brand india”. the next year the party’s general secretary said the bjp saw the diaspora as india’s voice abroad, “the way the jewish community looks out for israel’s interests in the united states”. many indians abroad have risen to the task. the overseas friends of the bjp in america plans to send 3,000 indian-american activists back to india to put up posters and canvass voters. they say they will make 2.5m calls to people in india to persuade them to vote for mr modi. the indian overseas congress, the equivalent outfit representing the opposition congress party, has similar plans, though its organisers are vague about numbers. india’s opaque electoral-finance system makes it tricky to gauge exactly how much money the diaspora contributes; parties are rarely required to disclose the source of donations. but it is bound to be a lot. the most rabid supporters live outside enjoying the facilities and income from first world countries. yet they are happy to drown india into darkness. wonder how many of them will be willing to cancel their own pr/citizenship and come home and enjoy it here","A detailed post discusses PM Modi's popularity among the Indian diaspora ('NRIs').

1bx40n7,"why india’s elite loves narendra modi they became elites because of exactly this type of politics and want to stay there. it's not just elite he is really loved by many common people as well,and the ones who love him are really into religion and all sorts. so the elite do love him but that's just less than 5% of the total vote bank he receives compared to normal people. it's cuz the andbhakts don't have any idea about what's going around them. they don't have any logic and a sober mind to think. they just wanna believe what is fed to them. all want to believe in lies. might get bashed but it’s ok. because of the sense of pride and possibility that is conveyed. instead of feeling sorry you get the message of proud being an indian. also, it has been profitable to be a businessman in general, money flow and contract execution with invoice payments are in general better than it has ever been even small scale. and other small factors such as low level corruption has decreased due to digitisation. [why india’s elite loves narendra modi (archive.is)]( narendra modi, india's prime minister, is often lumped together with right-wing populists such as donald trump or viktor orban. on the surface, the comparison is plausible. in 2019 mr modi told the *indian express*, a newspaper, that his electoral success was not due to “the khan market gang or lutyens delhi”, monikers for india’s old establishment. rather, said mr modi, he pulled himself up through “45 years of toil”. but the prime minister, who is expected to win a third term after india goes to the polls later this month, is no ordinary strongman. in most places support for anti-establishment populists, such as mr trump, and policies such as brexit tends to be inversely correlated with university education. not in india. call it the modi paradox. it helps explain why he is the most popular leader of any major democracy today.a study in 2020 of britain, turkey, eight countries in the european union and five in latin america by cristóbal rovira and steven van hauwaert, two political scientists, confirmed the inverse relationship between higher education and support for populist leaders. it is not universal: jair bolsonaro, brazil’s president from 2019 to 2022, was backed by some of the best-educated elites. but in america it is strong. in december 2023 gallup, a pollster, found that just 26% of respondents with a university education approved of mr trump, compared with 50% of those without. mr modi bucks this trend altogether (see chart). in 2017, 66% of indians who had no more than a primary-school education told pew research that they had a “very favourable” view of mr modi. the number rose to 80% among indians with at least some higher education. after the previous general election, in 2019, lokniti-csds, a pollster, found that around 42% of indians with a degree supported mr modi’s bharatiya janata party (bjp), while around 35% of those with only a primary-school education did. polls conducted after state elections in 2023, such as in karnataka, confirm the trend. similarly pew’s latest survey, from last year, shows that 60% of university-educated indians have a very favourable opinion of mr modi, compared with 55% of those who do not have a degree. # a psephological puzzle mr modi’s success among the well-educated does not come at the expense of support among other groups. indeed, like other populist leaders, his biggest inroads have been made among lower-class voters, says neelanjan sircar, a political scientist at the centre for policy research, a think-tank in delhi. in 2020 sanjay kumar of the centre for the study of developing societies found that between 2014 and 2019 support for the bjp increased among rural, lower-caste, young and poor voters. it grew especially quickly among “other backward classes”, which make up nearly half of the population. among them, the bjp’s support rose from 34% to 44%, compared with an increase of 31% to 38% among all voters.this pattern of support for the bjp is comparable to other countries in which less-educated or rural people have shifted right. but unlike many of his counterparts abroad, mr modi has also been able to increase his support among the educated. three factors—class politics, economics, and elite admiration for strongman rule—help explain [why.in]( india, class is intertwined with the caste system. the bjp, like many conservative parties, is known to be business-friendly. a core constituency includes much of the “bania” trader community, a traditionally business-oriented group concentrated in states such as gujarat and rajasthan. tycoons such as mukesh ambani and gautam adani, india’s richest men, fall into this group. upper-caste hindus, including kshatriyas and brahmins, are also part of the core support base. some regional parties, such as the dmk in tamil nadu, have positioned themselves against such upper-caste groups. congress, the main national opposition party, has championed preferential access to education and government jobs for lower castes.","An analysis of why India's elite loves Modi. The post argues that elites benefit from stability and business-friendly policies, but user comments point out that Modi's support is actually broad-based, including many poor and lower-caste voters ('Modi paradox'). The 'elite' support is attributed to pride in India's global standing and financial gains (contract execution, digitization) rather than just ideology.","['Analysis: Why elites support Modi (Business/Stability)', 'Counter-point: Support is broad-based, including poor/OBCs (Modi Paradox)', 'Role of national pride and global standing', 'Economic factor: Better contract execution and digitization', 'Discussion on the inverse relationship between education and populism not applying']",Public Sentiment

in part, their preference for the bjp reflects the party’s general success. it has used its deep pockets and organisation to ensure that people around the country associate improvements in living standards with mr modi’s time in charge. it presents any government programme, whether the distribution of free grain, which 800m people benefit from, or the building of new roads and the installation of electricity and water connections, as a gift dispensed by the prime minister himself. adverts for government handouts carry his picture; the party’s manifesto comes in the form of 24 “modi’s guarantees”. “we are struggling, but all the good things my family has—cooking gas, bank accounts, electricity—we owe to mr modi,” says siyaram, a 23-year-old who runs a food cart in patna. the bjp is also good at social media, where most young people consume news, says prateek waghre of the internet freedom foundation, an advocacy group in delhi. mr modi directly communicates with nearly 100m followers on x (formerly twitter). the prime minister has almost 90m followers on instagram, which has between 360m and 500m active users in india, most of them younger than 35. he sweet-talks indians on his monthly radio show, short clips of which make it onto whatsapp and instagram. the bjp was also early to build relationships with influencers on instagram and youtube. by contrast, congress, the main opposition party, has only belatedly started targeting young people through social media. many young people also think mr modi’s government has raised the profile of the country. a study published earlier this year by the observer research foundation, a think-tank in delhi, found that 83% of urban indians between 18 and 35 approved of the country’s foreign policy. as many again saw the country’s g20 presidency, a rotational position touted by the government as mr modi’s personal achievement, as an effective way of tackling india’s interests abroad. certain development policies also find near-universal approval. though some young people may not think that the government has improved their own circumstances, they still appear to think mr modi has done some good for the country. some of their problems also predate the bjp. job growth has been poor: despite economic growth averaging 6.4% each year over the past 30 years, the number of jobs grew by only 1.6% a year between 2000 and 2012 and not at all between 2012 and 2019. young people are particularly affected. they have become better educated over the past two decades, yet their employment situation has deteriorated over the same period. labour-force participation has fallen and unemployment has risen among people under the age of 30. the bnp’s manifesto vows to create more jobs by investing in infrastructure and by promoting manufacturing and entrepreneurship. but the plans are thin on detail. this lack of progress may eventually come back to bite mr modi. so far, protests against the dire employment situation have been sporadic, most notably in response to an army reform that reduced benefits for new recruits. yet turnout in the first two phases of the election has been lower than in 2019, perhaps suggesting waning enthusiasm for mr modi. for now, young people seem willing to give his government the benefit of the doubt. unless he delivers on jobs this time around, they may not do so again. ■ that's what manufacturing consent looks like.","A detailed analysis of why disillusioned young Indian voters still favor Modi despite high unemployment. The post argues that while youth are dissatisfied with jobs (57% pessimistic), they don't blame Modi due to effective propaganda, association of welfare with him personally ('Modi's guarantees'), and national pride (foreign policy/G20).

1bt99l6,"why the indian public does not seem to care about arvind kejriwal’s arrest the biggest scam of this govt isnt electoral bonds or getting in bed with crony capitalists or anything else. it's the systematic brainwashing and desensitizing of the common persons psyche. they have very successfully erased critical thinking, common sense and morality from the public minds.. they can arrest the whole opposition and get away with it which they will soon do... two relevant things i've read about this - there was a piece in the print(an indian centrist news site) that suggests the modi government predicted this kind of public apathy and that's why they went through with something as audacious as the arrest; after all conventional wisdom(which i also followed when i first read about this) would suggest that this would create a massive sympathy wave for aap and kejriwal, particularly in delhi. - i just read an excellent piece in the economist(an international magazine that i highly recommend for their surprisingly nuanced analysis for regions like the middle east, south asia etc) that suggests the indian educated classes do actually find incidents like kejriwal's arrest and the tax raids against the congress to be a turn-off, but have convinced themselves that ""the good outweighs the bad"" about strongman modi, at least for now. i just don't care anymore. i used to debate anyone who would listen after 2014 that our country is going down the drain. over the years i have realised people are too bull headed to listen. they have never taken any interest in history so these things don't make much sense to them. there's a lack of critical thinking as well. i just don't talk politics with any of my acquaintances anymore. kejriwal, despite of doing great work in education and health sector (which i feel is the most urgent requirement) does not have loyal support base like bjp or even congress have. many upper caste uncles (core bjp supporters) hate kejriwal and label him as a khalist@ni or a terrorist or anti-national idea. many congress supporters/muslim label him as bjp's b team because of his soft hindutva approach towards politics recently. but the man has grit, determination and sincerity. he is super adaptable to political environment. i have studied with his daughter in iitd and believe me i wasn't aware even after 3 sem that she was his daughter (since she was in a different dept in first year and changed her dept (obv through good grades) to chem eng). super sharp, smart, modest and low profile despite being the daughter of a cm. she was i think dr 4 at the time of graduation, placed in bcg. her brother also got into iitd. hardwork runs in this family's genes. coming back to ak. i believe he has much of his loyal base in poor household who are not present anywhere on the internet/social media but votes him as long as his policies benefit them. (article) --- delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal’s arrest was months in the making, with him refusing to appear in front of the enforcement directorate (ed) for nine consecutive summons. when it happened — the arrest of a sitting opposition chief minister in the lead-up to a national election — a watershed moment in the history of indian democracy seemed all too prosaic. delhi went about its business as usual. politicians tweeted their reactions along predictable lines. courts were moved with predictable results. the bjp and opposition supporters argued in various arenas about authoritarianism and corruption. a whatsapp group of senior public policy and government affairs professionals — a niche set of individuals particularly attuned to and connected with state power — discussed the possibility of traffic jams affecting their day’s programmes. others reassured that the roads were clear. it is too soon to predict how this will ultimately play out but some observations are pertinent. first, there’s an unmistakable sense of isolation of the political class. people have opinions about various developments within the political class but as detached observers. the ed raids on opposition leaders, the freezing of the congress party’s bank accounts and the arrest of two sitting cms (jharkhand cm, hemant soren resigned in anticipation) are watched with dispassionate interest — without feeling like these developments have any bearing on their own lives. it is not difficult to see how we have arrived at this point. political parties have evolved into closed clubs where the average person has very little visibility in decision-making, let alone influence. moreover, the political class is seen to be self-serving and the basis of the relationship between political parties and people has become transactional with the expectation of well-defined economic benefits from voting one party or another into power. this is neither a unique nor durable foundation for substantive affiliation between specific political parties, its leaders and the people. this has a direct impact on the nature of our democracy. representative democracy is operationalised through political parties. however, if there is a popular disconnect with democracy’s primary institutional intermediary, then it ceases to be seen as a public good. the inevitable result of this is a thinning conception of citizenship and voter apathy. we can then provide all the information in the world but there is no path to popular investment in democracy without fixing disenchantment with the political class. a sense of personal stake in representative democracy requires not just information but engendering the feeling that the political parties/leaders in question are custodians of their personal interests and thus truly their representatives in delhi. liberals like us may prattle on about the virtues of democracy at large but india’s only liberal political party too suffers from this popular disconnect. this is because the basis of indian liberalism typically has been institutionalism and the espousal of tolerance and social welfare instead of a normative vision which can provide people clarity, identity and community. in the absence of personal affiliation, abstractions about democracy often have little bearing on people’s daily lives. there is no doubt that the democratic space in india is shrinking, but this abridgement is targeted. it is thus most keenly felt by the beleaguered minority or on the margins by those who are directly in the crosshairs of the government, such as the opposition, media and activists. for the rest, the difference, if any, is marginal. the daily wage worker, the peon, the domestic worker, the auto driver who gets slapped around for collection by the policeman have always known arbitrary power and are unlikely to experience a difference in their life unless they are directly engaged and politicised. even for those at the top who may directly interface with political actors, most people just put their heads down and carry on through a mix of opportunism and sycophancy. this is likely what they would have done in a more expansive democracy as well. the popular disconnect with the political class may explain why the bjp is preemptively knocking out its opponents in a contest it was slated to win anyway. likely, the electorate at large will not be incensed enough by this predatory behaviour to impose a high political cost on the bjp. on the other hand, there are significant advantages of consolidating political power, not least the ability to implement its full ideological agenda and position itself for the long term by eviscerating the opposition. this doesn’t bode well for our country going forward because the willingness of the bjp to undermine its own democratic legitimacy removes the last check — self-restraint — on its abuse of executive power. finally, what does it mean for the opposition going forward? it would be hyperbole to predict the demise of indian democracy irrespective of the outcome of the national election in 2024. our country is too large and federated to be suppressed in one shot. its expanse and diversity will always provide spaces for democratic action even when institutions falter. however, the opposition must find a way out of its isolation through a deeper connect with people’s lives. *the writer is the executive director of future of india foundation*","A detailed post discusses why the public seems apathetic to Kejriwal's arrest.

1drjkbn,"as sanjay raut pitches for uddhav thackeray as cm face, sharad pawar shoots down idea as was the case in 2019, i predict cracks forming among the members of the winning coalition over the post of cm as soon as the results are announced for the next assembly election in maharashtra. it will be interesting to see what the shiv sena would do if uddhav thackeray is denied the post by the maha vikas aghadi. (article) --- even as sena (ubt) continues to insist that uddhav thackeray be projected as chief ministerial face of maha vikas aghadi for the ensuing assembly elections, ncp (sp) chief sharad pawar today rejected any such idea. “our alliance is our collective face. one individual can’t become our cm face. collective leadership is our formula,” pawar told reporters in kolhapur today when asked about sena mp sanjay raut’s insistence on uddhav thackeray as cm face of mva. pawar said discussions regarding polls are yet to take place. “we have not yet discussed anything about assembly elections. all three alliance partners will take a decision in this regard,” he said. calling for including all the other parties and those opposed to pm narendra modi in mva, pawar said, ”during the recent ls elections, the pwp, aap and communist parties helped us. though we are three partners in mva, we should include all these parties. all those opposed to modi should become part of mva. whatever the decision regarding the cm face, it will be taken after discussion and after taking everyone into confidence,” he said. two days after calling for making uddhav thackeray, the cm face, raut today again emphasised that if mva goes ahead without a cm face, it will be hit adversely in the assembly elections which are likely to be held in october. “it will be wrong on the part of mva to go ahead without a cm face. if a cm is projected, it will create a positive atmosphere in our favour, and help get more seats. otherwise we will be pegged on the backfoot,” he told the indian express. earlier this week, raut caused quite a buzz in political circles when he pitched uddhav as the cm face of mva. ”going to elections in maharashtra without a cm face will be dangerous for mva. maharashtra has seen how uddhav thackeray has handled the state, especially during the crucial covid period. people voted for mva due to his popularity. a faceless alliance will not help our cause,” raut had said two days back. today, raut cited india bloc’s performance and an absence of the pm face to drive home his point. ”if india bloc had projected rahul gandhi as the pm face, it would have got 25-30 more seats. no government or organisation can remain without a face. people must know who they are voting for. people voted for indira gandhi and narendra modi. they want to know the face. we don’t have differences over who should be our cm face. we are determined to contest unitedly and will win 175 to 180 assembly seats,” he said. when asked whether thackeray was ready to be the cm face, raut shot back,”you can pose that question to him (uddhav).” raut said the matter was open to discussion. “we will take up the issue at the mva meeting and arrive at a consensus. but i will continue to back uddhav because of his popularity among the masses,” he said. advertisement while congress leaders like balasaheb thorat and nitin raut said mva will take a joint decision in this regard, mpcc chief nana patole said,”we have decided not to comment on any statement made by sanjay raut.”","The lengthy post details a rift within the Maharashtra opposition alliance (MVA) over projecting a Chief Ministerial face for the upcoming state elections. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut is insisting Uddhav Thackeray be the CM face, arguing a faceless alliance will hurt them.

The article and user comments predict this will lead to cracks and difficult negotiations post-results, similar to 2019. Users analyze the strategic merits, with some agreeing with Raut that a clear face helps voters, citing the INDIA bloc's lack of a PM face as a potential reason for losing seats.

(covid 2021). our people were dying like rats, and there was no accountability, no repercussions, no response. he resorts to deflecting blame on men who have been long dead to cover up for his own incompetence even after 10 years of unbridled power. 1 km of 4 lanes is now considered 4 kms, if electricity is provided to 10% households in a particular village, it is deemed that the entire village has been electrified, these are jacking up numbers, these numbers are then being proliferated at pace which can be considered as a form of disinformation especially as there are some nefarious devils in the details. organised an event that is allocated without any merit, and projected it as being a mega achievement to his gullible followers. and now they want to host cop26 before 2029 elections which would imply they intend to keep indians dumb and gullible for another 5 years at least. polarisation of public and pulverisation of republic (i came up with this and i love it). not to imply that there are no positives under modi. he has delivered on several fronts, most significant of which was national security. yes there were quite a few terror attacks in his regime as well but let’s not forget the pre-2014 weekly terror attacks. no city, no state was spared or safe. where it wasn’t islamists or pakistan sponsored terrorists, we had militants. a relative of mine was shot dead in 2009 by hnlc militants for not agreeing to what would be a fifth ransom payment.

well, [ulfa disbands itself after peace agreement, to hand over arms]( economy was handed the triple shock of demonetisation, gst and 2019 union budget but since then they’ve tempered with it to a controlled degree. our tax incidence has reduced without damaging our fiscal position (i may be culturally liberal, but fiscally i’m as conservative as they come) and in spite of the plethora of challenges nda 2 faced (covid, ukraine war, houthi attacks all of which pressurised brent crude), they are not withering from the targets to consolidate our debts. i appreciate how he’s not backing down against outside intervention in our fragile state of punjab. there is unprecedented (world class and not just basic) infrastructural development. this and many more, i’ve directly not been a direct beneficiary of anything as such, but he has a 70 odd percent approval rating, i’m assuming those in mainland are getting something at least. i may criticise modi all i want but truth be told he possesses the potential to enact transformative change in india and could change the fortunes of the country by his sheer cult of personality. if we could just impose certain costs that would make him focus on prioritising governance over electoral victories and refrain from divisive tactics such as conniving, lying, manipulating, and gas-lighting others to that end, which we know he’s capable of, he very well could go down as india’s ataturk. per the status quo, though, he’s gonna go down as the hindu zia ul haq who converted—although scarcely but functionally—a secular india into hindu pakistan. those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. its that simple, really. if we could remind him, who he is, if we could just make him come out of this mega whatever induced trip that he’s on, and realise he will be remembered for longer if he makes us rich than he will be for refurbishing temple arenas, that could and would transform our fortunes. if we could somehow… he will be given the power, he and his team has the vision, enough manpower and with some effort he could get the money as well. if we could just remind him his mode of effective and efficient governance, and not he, was supposed to be the gujarat model that india gets, minus the minority stomping and oligarchy appeasement ofc, that’d be great. aayega toh modi hi, toh kyun na pre-2016 modi ko laye? because otherwise, think about it, this inducting members into the party regardless of their character so long as they augur positive electoral outcomes, vociferously targeting super-majority in parliament, stomping on small time politicians which one could construe as a lab rat experiment for bigger things to come, what the they up to? whatever that is, if it isn’t what modi promised in 2014, it portends dangerous, ominous signals. construe it howsoever you feel like, just remember there are decades when nothing happen, and then there are days when decades happen. there is no pre-2016 / post-2016 modi. it's all preplanned. what you're seeing now is his real self (and the rss' real self), now that his invincibility is assured. if you look at the many religious babas that our country is infested with, they progress along the same lines. when they start off, they hype up their image with a mixture of real and imaginary charitable deeds, miracles etc. and make sure word about them spreads in all manner possible. once the congregation size achieves a certain critical mass and the brand name gets established, that's when the rapes and other shenanigans start, but by that time they're too big and too famous and too powerful for anyone to touch them. its just like saying if not putin then who? the entire aura around modi is a media created public image management masterpiece. you do realize that most of policies of country are created by bureaucrats. modi and amit shah don't sit and decide where to build next port or bridge. modi did the stupidest thing of demonetization. tughlaq was declared mad king for such stupidities. there is a reason the guy has never given a press conference. the corruption has been there, but again the media manages it in such a way that people don't notice it (anil ambani defence company for rafale cost offset, electoral bonds, pm cares funds !!) for once people should stop flattering themselves by thinking they are playing pm-maker and just vote for the best candidate in your constituency. let the overall picture take care of itself. eci just reported that since march 1, they have seized nearly 100 crore everyday, while we struggle to get small funds for local maintenance. our cities and town are crumbling. start voting for local improvement rather than inflating your ego by pretending to understand how fate of nation is on edge. if not modi, it should be a well-tamed modi. how do we do that? how we knock some sense into him? how do we show him power lies with people? by hoping bjp doesn't get a majority. or barely manages to. so vote smartly. think win-win. talk to your peers according. we dont have to rid the nation off modi. we just need to temper things a bit. let hope flicker. cheers i'm glad you have come to your senses but when will you realise you were brainwashed before 2016?","A detailed user analysis contrasts 'pre-2016 Modi' (development, anti-corruption, centrist) with 'current Modi' (polarizing, cult of personality, misuse of agencies).

1aspawi,"some facts about the farmer's protest been seeing a lot of comments and post about how agreeing to the farmer's demand would cost 10+ lakh crores. i hope you do realise that it is blatant propoganda. this article below does a decent job of debunking it. just a little bit of research would help you separate fact from fiction/propoganda. apart from this, the total debt of the farmers comes up to around 2 lakh crores. do you guys have any idea about the loans written off for the biggest corpos in the country since the last 10 years? it is over 4 times over the total debt of all farmers in the whole country. you really think that it's fair that corpos receive this kind of treatment and be allowed to go scot free while the farmers far from receiving debt waiver, receive rubber bullets, pellets, tear gas and worse??? i request you guys to be a little bit empathetic and informed. it breaks my heart that the youth of the country has 0 empathy for the eveage person but are gladly bootlicking big coporates. y'all need to wake the fuck up. thanks. i personally don’t think msp is really a problem. but i feel like it should be accompanied with taxation for farmers above a certain income(same as salaried folks above 5lacs). it would probably cut down a lot of the additional burden. and before people say that such farmers are too few, let’s remember that while less 5-6% people pay income tax they end up contributing around 20% of revenue for the government. but the moment any government introduces taxations for farmers(no matter how rich), they will loose the next election. so don’t think this topic really has a good solve without funding one more freebie and taking it up as an additional permanent expense the msp government sets at is 1.5 above cost while the asked msp 50% above cost. your calculation itself has got 1.3% of budget just on msp going by farmer demands. you forget to add these to the list 1) loan waiver cost 2) subsidised electricity cost 3) loss on tax revenue 4) subsidised other agriculture related necessities. now what a higher msp also does is raise cost of all crops in the market. so it will not encourage more buying of indian cereals but actually reduce purchase of all crops. total food inflation is going to drastically increase. now imagine what a poor labourer who is not into farming going to do with such prices. now the procured crop government has to sell. if it cannot sell at profit further adds cost. more fiscal deficit. that is why, what the economist say is right and not just simple math calculation done in this article which even a 12th pass can do. the main problem with farming is the middle men, misuse of loans, environmental issues, lack of diversification in crops, no improvement in farming techniques etc. msp is justifiable but at much lower levels than what it is being demanded. and those effected by drought or environmental issues should be supported more than lands with excces water and good soil as in punjab. am going to repost an old comment of mine. before we romanticise the life of indian farmers, let’s acknowledge a few facts. let’s start with a few structural challenges on the farming. 1. ⁠the average farm size in india is 2 hectares. and with every generation, it is getting fragmented further. under no reasonable scenarios, this is sufficient to keep a family of 5 above poverty levels. 2. ⁠low productivity: limited irrigation (less than 60%), low yield per acre (compared to europe and china) for most crops (cotton, sugarcane etc seem to be exception) due to input quality and farming practices. 3. ⁠price risks: farm produce is a commodity and hence prices swing wildly based on demand and supply. also the governments have incentives to keep prices affordable to manage retail inflation. high tomatoes and onions prices have brought down governments. 4. ⁠perishable commodity: without infrastructure and packaging/processing to enhance shelf life, farmers have to sell at spot prices and often do not have an option to wait for better prices later on. 5. ⁠fragmented inefficient market aka mandi system apmc: movement of agricultural goods across state and sometime apmc boundaries is heavily regulated. 6. ⁠inefficient value chain: the indian farmer receives just 10% to 23% of the price the indian consumer pays for exactly the same produce, the difference going to losses, inefficiencies and middlemen. farmers in developed economies of europe and the united states receive 64% to 81%. take these numbers with a pinch of salt (pun intended) to exclude staples like wheat and rice. 7. ⁠availability of credit: farmer loans are bad business for banks. besides the regular credit risk of price and yield uncertainty, politics of loan waiver discourages organised sector from lending to farmers. now let’s talk about some solutions by accepting that there is no silver bullet to the malaise in agriculture and agreeing on a goal - india’s gdp per capita needs to double to $4000 and farmer should be able to participate at this average. assuming a nuclear family size of 5, that’s 14lpa goal. current average estimated income for an agricultural household is 1.2lpa. so the goal is 12x. 1. ⁠we need to accept that indian economy needs to shift away from agriculture. there is no way we can guarantee a sustainable income to farmers with less than 2 hectares farm size. even if farm yield doubles and irrigated land is maximised, 14lpa is not a reasonable target. every marginal farmer knows that his next generation cannot bank on the family farm for survival. 2. ⁠let’s see what a workable plan looks like. 2x on farm yield, 2x on farm size, 3x on % of final price captured by farmers. that’s 12x. 3. ⁠that means, 50% of next generation of farmers need to be transitioned to a different sector of the economy - manufacturing and service. 4. ⁠farming needs to modernise and become sustainable (seed quality, water management, fertiliser etc) to double the yield. 5. ⁠shift the value chain in favour of the farmer. structural reforms in agriculture trading, better infrastructure to reduce waste etc. experts know what needs to be done. but the leadership to do this requires making hard decisions. but then best parents give the child what she needs (green vegetables and education) and not what she wants (only chocolates and playtime). ps: any sustainable solution has to be a market based solution. welfare and subsidies can be the pain relief but should not be mistaken for a cure for commercial private enterprise that farming eventually is. wish there were better quality food products in inida. if this results in that so be it 2 lakh crores and not 10 lakh crores? thats your argument? why do only some farmers who have lands get the waive off while the lot of other farmer workers who toiled the blood and sweat and could not even get a bank loan and took loans from loan sharks get waive off? why not every one in india with income less than 10 lkahs given a bail out? i can raise lot of bullshit arguments like these bullshit posts like these is why we have stupidity written all over. farm reforms are needed , no question about it but these protests are only from certain section northwest farmers who are doing the protests , strong arming the govt at the expense of general tax payers is bad and never should be encouraged. waiving of loans creates a bad precedence and encourages people taking unnecessary and non productive outcomes.","A detailed post debunks the '10 lakh crore cost' of MSP, arguing for empathy towards farmers vs corporate write-offs.

1at9228,"farmer protests: 'msp needed, that it will cost government rs 10 lakh crore is misinformation' the blitzkreig is real. no comments here? really? from the article: 1/2 farmers are back on the march, and the government as usual is back on the defensive while tv channels and newspapers are full of experts explaining why the farmers’ demands are unrealistic and impractical. their reasons range from - ‘india simply doesn’t have enough money’, to ‘where are the warehouses required to store all that produce?’ there are also those who oppose it on ideological grounds -- ‘why should the farmers be insulated from the vagaries of the market?’, ‘linking their income to demand and supply will encourage productivity and innovation’ and so on. minimum support prices and public procurement, they point out, are soviet-era tools that have been proven to be inefficient and useless. yet, amid all this, author, researcher, farmers' rights activist and former journalist devinder sharma stands apart as a voice staunchly in support of the agitating farmers. sharma, the author of books such as gatt to wto: seeds of despair and in the famine trap, spoke to the new indian express on why he supports the farmers’ demand for msp, and addressed the various objections against it. q - the biggest objection to the demand for msp is that we don’t have enough resources. government sources claim that implementing the msp scheme will cost rs 10 lakh crore per year, equal to our total expenditure on infrastructure. similarly, they argue that the government doesn’t have the warehouses to procure all agricultural items, only grains and pulses. how do you address these objections? a - i am not asking the government to procure everything. that’s a kind of an illusion they are creating, to create a fear-psychosis. we are saying, make msp a legal instrument. this does not mean that the government will procure everything. msp will be a benchmark price below which nobody will purchase, whether it’s the agent, private traders or public agencies. so, the government doesn’t have to come into play. only at certain times, government's intervention may be required. q - how exactly will this system work? what happens when there’s too much produce in the market and there are no takers for the excess produce at msp? who will buy the excess produce? a - when such a situation takes place and farmers are not able to sell their produce, the government must pay the farmers.. that’s an intervention that is required. even in a country like america, when the milk is surplus, what do they do? they feed it again to the cows or throw it, but farmers are paid. they also ask farmers to convert it into cheese which is distributed in the schools or sold. the government compensates farmers in such cases. q - where will we get rs 10 lakh crore from? a - [the figure of rs 10 lakh crore] is misinformation. the government doesn’t have to purchase everything that is produced in india. it has to step in only when prices crash and farmers are forced to sell their produce below the set price. we have got the studies which say very clearly that if the government intervenes at that level when prices dip too much, it’s not going to be more than rs 1.5 lakh to 2.0 lakh crore every year. the karnataka agricultural prices commission too says the same. however, a crisil study examining 16 of the 23 crops for which msp is announced says the real cost to the government will be rs 21,000-crore for the marketing year 2023. q - but still, is that the right use of taxpayer money? a - when you announce an economic stimulus to corporates, do you ask these questions? do you ask where the money has come from? the rs 15 lakh crore that has been written off by banks as bad loans, is that not a kind of an economic stimulus? but when it’s farmers’ turn, everybody starts jumping up and down saying where will the money come from. everyone else has income security. look at how you deal with government employees. for them, you have set up a system that lays out the kind of salaries that have to be fixed after a few years gap. we had the 7th pay commission, and it cost an additional expenditure of rs 4.5 lakh crore when it was implemented across the country. no one asked from where the money will come from. it is all assured income and guaranteed pay. but when it comes to farmers, all kinds of questions are used. you want to leave them at the mercy of the market, demand and supply. markets have failed to provide an assured income anywhere in the world. how long do you want farmers to continue suffering, dying and committing suicide? is 75 years not enough? since the national crime records bureau started compiling the data on farmer suicides, nearly 4-lakh farmers have committed suicide, and you are still singing the praise of the markets? markets have failed everywhere in the world, why do you think such a failed model should be brought into india...are we worried that if the farmers get higher income, corporate profits would be reduced? give them a guaranteed minimum price. whatever income they generate, they are going to spend it. it will in turn generate huge demand in the economy. the wheels of the development will run faster. if you give farmers a legal msp, the economic growth will jump to the double digits immediately. q - another related argument – particularly from the side of the industry – is that the kind of money that is being spent on income assurance for the farmers can be better utilized to create storage infrastructure by the government, and this storage infrastructure can be used to store the produce during times of excess and low prices. what do you think of that idea? a - if the corporates are so keen on this idea, pay the msp to the farmers, purchase the produce, store it or do whatever you want. farmers will have no problem. 2/2 q - there is also a fear that if the farmer incomes rise and they consume more, it will lead to inflation. how do you address such concerns? a - all this is part of attempts to create a fear psychosis. look at the media today. one of the anchors was saying - there will be 20%, 25% inflation if msp is legalized. i am thankful to him that he didn’t say 150% inflation. he could have said that also, because today we know what media is all about today. the point i am trying to make is, there is no other way…farmers have come to protest only because they are getting prices that are not even fit for a living income. the national income of farmers, according to the latest situational assessment survey for agricultural households in 2019, tells us that the average income of a farming household – which may have people who may be running a shop, or involved in mnrega – is only 10,218 rupees per month. that is at the bottom of the pyramid. today’s economy has been designed in such a way that it has really sacrificed agriculture for the sake of industry. this cannot go on: the nation must wake up and rescue the 50% of the population living in penury. it is a difficult pathway, because we haven’t tried it earlier, but it’s completely possible. that’s the kind of reform india needs. what is wrong with 50% of india’s population also becoming economically prosperous? why are we opposed to prosperity on the farm? q - a lot of people are asking why only farmers from punjab, haryana and western uttar pradesh are protesting, when most of the current msp procurement – almost entirely in the form of rice and wheat – is from these states. a - yes punjab farmers already get msp for their primary crops. but they are standing for the farmers from the rest of the country. they are saying, in punjab and haryana we get the msp, but the rest of the country should also get the msp. another reason is that because they are in close proximity to new delhi, they are the ones who can raise their voice there. q - some feel that 50%, as suggested by the swaminathan commission, is too high a return for the farmers, and this will wreck the economy. how do you react to that? a - dr swaminathan was a very distinguished agriculturist. he was the agriculture secretary of india at one time, he was with the planning commission at one time. he has been an internationally recognized scientist. the world listened to him. when he recommended c2+50%, do you think he was not aware what c2+50% would mean to the country’s economy? why do all these bureaucrats sitting in the ministry of agriculture think they know better than swaminathan? today, we are so much under pressure from corporates that we don’t even want to acknowledge the tremendous role played by swaminathan in providing that formula that the country needs to adopt…if you can give him bharat ratna, you can also take up the formula he gave for the betterment of the masses. that will be the solution for ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ q - lastly, there are also those who ask - why should the government procure produce at a high price from indian farmers when the same can be purchased from international markets at a lower price… a - it is very sad that we have forgotten the ship-to-mouth existence india was living in one time not long ago. food was coming directly from the ship to hungry mouths. we struggled so hard. punjab farmers put up their entire effort to see the country become self-sufficient. today, there’s complacency in the country, because we get food every night on our table, we don’t think it matters anymore. but we don’t realize that all those countries that did not become self-sufficient are facing lots of problems today. it would be foolish if we think we can import food from abroad and achieve food security. even a country like the us, the world’s greatest economy, puts in all kinds of protection measures to ensure they are not flooded with cheaper food from the rest of the world. if they can protect their food security, why, as a nation, are we ashamed to do that? i think this kind of thinking over the years has come because of the free market mantra.. but if we accept that, then we can also ask why we need industry in india, we can import stuff from outside. let’s not forget the words of dr swaminathan – the future belongs to nations with grains, not guns.","Devinder Sharma defends MSP, arguing the '10 lakh crore' cost is misinformation aimed at creating fear.

peak. attacks on dalits, adivasis, minorities and women are on a rise. our nation is being thrown into the fire of communalism and hate for the political gains. **unemployment has become a national calamity.** the modi government, which came to power with the promise of two crore jobs, has betrayed the youth. permanent jobs are being privatized and contractualized. regular employment is shrinking, while wages are declining in real terms. in 2019, the unemployment rate reached its highest level in 45 years. today, the youth unemployment in india stands at 40%, while more than 30 lakh sanctioned government posts are lying vacant. through the agnipath scheme, the government has compromised the national security and the future of the youth. youths who demand employment are being violently repressed. **government has pushed the farmers and workers in a terrible tragedy.** rising unemployment, falling income and price rise has wreaked havoc on the workers. public sector units are being privatized. the government, which came to power with the promise of minimum support price and doubling the income of farmers, has betrayed the farmers. agricultural income has declined, and farmers are falling in debt and dying by suicide. in 2020, when the nation was under lockdown, the government passed the anti-farmer laws in a conspiracy with the capitalists. in a struggle against this, 750 farmers lost their lives. meanwhile, a violent persecution and propaganda against the farmers continues to this day. **economic inequality is at its peak.** the poor and middle class are facing the brunt of inflation, while the government is distributing lakhs of crores of loan waivers and tax cuts to the crony capitalists. in the last three years, while the nation was reeling under covid pandemic and economic downturn, the number of billionaires in india increased from 102 to 169. allegations of corruption and corporate fraud have been covered up, and those raising questions have been silenced. at the same time, domestic savings have fallen to its lowest level in five decades. social security and senior citizen's concessions are being taken away. the price of essential household items, including oil and gas, have risen sharply. meanwhile, hunger and malnutrition has pushed the country to 111th place out of 125 countries in the global hunger index, with three-quarters of the population unable to afford a balanced-diet. in the last 10 years, **there has been an unprecedented rise in hatred and violence** against dalits, tribals, minorities and women.

their constitutional right to social justice.** forest law has been amended to facilitate corporate takeover of forests and drive the adivasis off their lands. overriding environmental concerns and objections raised by environmentalists and scientists, the government has pursued disastrous projects which has caused irreparable damage to the environment and the human life. the bjp government has launched an assault against universities and academic institutions. scientific and historical facts are being replaced with propaganda and falsehood. government has openly promoted unscientific and irrational ideas. **health and education budget have been slashed.** **there has been an unprecedented assault on democracy and the constitution.** mainstream media has become the megaphone of the government. independent journalists are being persecuted. any kind of protest or dissent is crushed with force. fundamental rights are being trampled. institutions like cbi, ed, income tax have been

man-made disaster. everything, from small businesses to everyday life, was thrown into despair. during the covid pandemic, without any regard for the common people, the government imposed nationwide lockdown at a four-hour notice. lakhs of workers lost their livelihood and crores of people had to face starvation. migrant workers had to walk thousands of kilometres on foot. **47 lakh people died of covid due to the government's indifference.** lakhs of people died without oxygen and hospital beds. due to a lack of space in crematoriums, rivers began overflowing with dead bodies. generating 2 crore employment opportunities every year, making india a $5 trillion economy by 2024, building 100 smart cities by 2023, doubling the farmer's income by 2022, creating 10 crore new jobs in the

failures, the modi government is using religion as its refuge. festivals and faith are being politicized. the public is being misled by spending crores of rupees on publicity. the reality of hunger,

1e4ujew,"the one truth that can explain everything wrong with india. i saw a journalist on twitter post a video of a man carrying his dead wife on his shoulder, exiting a hospital and marching his way home quite a distance away. the journalist mentioned in his caption how there’s no dignity in death, and there’s no ambulance or vehicle to carry the body home. however, i saw nothing wrong in it. this journalist was speaking with a strange expectation, something i call, “big city standards.” people in much of india have been living this way for hundreds of years. doesn’t he realize that? all of the problems that us big city folk feel, can be attributed to a misplaced expectation of 21st century modern city standards on a country that is still largely pre industrial, living in the agricultural age, and even in the agricultural age, much of india still lives with back breaking field work in sweltering heat using primitive tools. let me remind you all that only 30% of india lives in cities with some semblance of 21st century life. 70% of india lives in the pre industrial age, with lives comparable to pre wwi era. they might have cellphone connectivity and mobile phones, but their lives have largely not changed in the past hundred years, not by much anyway. i see lot of indians complaining on the lack of civic sense amongst indians. a lot of indians, even city dwellers do not know how to use a western cubicle to do their business. we see on gutka stains on the walls of public buildings or walls. we see garbage thrown on the streets (garbage segregation?! what’s that?). open defecation is still a thing. poor driving discipline. all of this is to be blamed on us not reaching the 21st century yet. we are hundreds of years behind. social change in the west, with movements such as feminism, human rights and equality rode on the back economic improvements powered by the industrial revolution. people in india either forget, or are simply not aware that india has not yet reached 21st century levels of industrialization. so even, socially, we remain a backward country with poor regard for women’s rights or human rights. even our democracy hasn’t reached 21st century standards because of this reason. we have a gdp per capita around the 2000$ range, with 800 million dependent on govt ration to feed themselves. putting people behind bars without a trial, and keeping them there for years is totally okay with the morals of 70% rural population and a big chunk of city dwellers are immigrants from rural areas. not tolerating criticism and always having your sentiments hurt is also a symptom of being an underdeveloped nation. just look at the way the laws are framed in this country, it resembles less like a developed democratic country and more similar to some autocratic regime. free speech is a joke in this country. innocent until proven guilty is a joke in the country. justice delivery is a joke. indian police procedure is a joke! the indian middle class which has slogged all its life studying for competitive exams and lives in broken cities with falling bridges, airports and hoardings, while traversing through flooded and pot hole infested roads basically does government charity for 5-6 months of a year. majority of tax is generated by them in these cities and all of that goes in subsidizing the lives of farmers and rural folk who don’t know what modern farming is, stubbornly refuse to listen to learned minds and are a perennial loss making venture, and default on all their loans only for the govt to waive it off, all at the expense of the taxpayer. they resist any kind of farm reform, and their resistance is violent sometimes, and keep increasing their demands for subsidies and keep demanding the govt buy their shitty produce at a price that they set with no regard for market forces. some idealistic middle class city dwellers call them “annadattas” and support them but they’re so brain dead cos they don’t realize that the failure of farmers to adopt modern farming is making their lives more expensive cos the govt has to extract the money from somewhere and it just so happens that the middle class is the most dependable cash cow. the politicians can’t do much no matter who it is, because they’ve to cater to 70% ignorant, uneducated people from the 17th century. not to mention staggering levels of corruption at all levels of industry and government. i expect nothing more from a 2000$ gdp per capita country. if you realize this one truth about india, you will pack your bags and make for greener pastures. cos ain’t nobody got hundreds of years to wait for india to become developed. btw, it is getting harder and harder to move to a developed country. while we still live in agricultural age, with primitive tools, developed countries are moving to the artificial intelligence age. tldr ; india is a pre industrial primitive agricultural country. it is improper to expect 21st century standards of life from a country where huge populations live like it’s the 17th century. the dignity of life, civic sense, consciousness of democratic rights, freedom of speech, fair justice system, humane police procedures etc are too utopian for common indian to access. it’ll take hundreds, if not thousands of years to achieve current western standards of life, dignity and democracy. those who can leave, should leave for greener pastures. i ate at a place today where the server washed his hand in a big container of water which was black in color and then served food to everyone with that same hand. only a handful of places in my city wouldn't probably get shut for food safety in other countries. my heart sank realising how much we lag behind the rest of the world. damn! hit hard. i had the same view 20 years ago so packed my bags and moved out. despite of all my struggles in the foreign shores, i never repented my decision to leave india. all because of what all you stated. india needs no less of a revolution and a 100% overhaul from society to infrastructure, politics, religion, all the way to the common man’s mindsets. i mean, in a middle school a harmless and innocent 12 years old boy is still not allowed to sit with his girl classmate. that too, in a big/metropolis city like delhi. when is that revolution coming? probably never. lived half my life in lucknow and studying in a college in delhi with most kids who have only lived in delhi. many of them couldn't think of living without ac. like i know people in my native village, who sleep in a hut made of straws, not even having a fan, i know someone who used to sleep on roadside (was 64 years old ), who died of heat stroke. people who have lived their whole life in tier 1 cities don't even realise that most of the population can't even afford most basic things. you kinda hit the nail here. this is the major reason i've hard a hard time relating to and discussing my problems with the folks in indian subs like this, these are city people. it goes completely unmentioned and unnoticed that the vast majority of our population lives in kaccha houses, without basic necessities like proper running water supply, less alone safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, a near decent diet, washing machines(imagine women washing the whole family's clothes all alone by hands with if lucky, some tap water supply), surviving 50°c heat with just fans or maybe not even that. i don't even have words to describe it all. the situation is deep, rotten, imagine a billion humans living like this in dirt poverty. just imagine how bad it is for women living in these homes. and always imagine way worse than your situation bc y'all are quite privileged. > social change in the west, with movements such as feminism, human rights and equality rode on the back economic improvements powered by the industrial revolution. people in india either forget, or are simply not aware that india has not yet reached 21st century levels of industrialization. industrial revolution in europe was funded by their colonies like asia & africa. plus living conditions were at an all time low during the industrial revolution. workers working for 16 hours, even women were working for 12 hours and kids were also expected to work despite having money from colonies. >majority of tax is generated by them in these cities and all of that goes in subsidizing the lives of farmers and rural folk who don’t know what modern farming is, stubbornly refuse to listen to learned minds and are a perennial loss making venture, and default on all their loans only for the govt to waive it off, all at the expense of the taxpayer. green revolution in india transformed the way we do farming around 1960. my uncle is a farmer he never got any of his loans waived off. all the money allocated to waive off goes into the pockets of the politicians and very little gets trickled down. especially for indian farmers as most of them don't have enough money to buy tractors as they don't own multiple acres of land. so many of them still rely on bulls & buffaloes. in my state the government is subsidizing small tractors which is nice it reduces the time needed for ploughing from 1 week to around 3 days. and current generation of farmers don't want to do farming they too want jobs. farming is not an easy endeavour. it requires a lot of time, effort & even after that u r still at the mercy of nature. and somehow u get a good yield u don't get a good price for ur yield. farming cannot sustain the livelihood of so many ppl. >some idealistic middle class city dwellers call them “annadattas” and support them but they’re so brain dead cos they don’t realize that the failure of farmers to adopt modern farming is making their lives more expensive cos the govt has to extract the money from somewhere and it just so happens that the middle class is the most dependable cash cow. nehru wanted india to be self sustaining which is very important for a country like india. it is not an easy job to feed a population of 100+ crore. we must appreciate our farmers they have a very tough life. well the current regime has reduced corporate tax to an all time low. if we increase corporate tax, tax the rich we won't need to increase tax on the middle class. >the politicians can’t do much no matter who it is, because they’ve to cater to 70% ignorant, uneducated people from the 17th century u underestimate the rural citizens of india. they r as smart as us & some r even more smarter than us. i know ppl in my village who scored more than 90% in vernacular medium without classes while also helping in farming activities. i know kids who r in 12th grade but also earning money on the side despite lack of opportunities at my village. >if you realize this one truth about india, you will pack your bags and make for greener pastures. cos ain’t nobody got hundreds of years to wait for india to become developed. india will never become a developed country. for a country to develop it's system (politicians, bureaucrats, society & ppl) must have a scientific attitude get rid of superstitions, religion, caste system, etc. plus our

1cxsltz,"we didn't live up to our potential as a country, i am not sure where we went wrong tho! i have few friends studying medicine in china and these people left india even though they had great colleges which people desire for here in india. i talk to them regularly and they are filled with praise for china, they love the infrastructure, they love shenzhen! and they send me photos of shenzhen and other cities which leaves me in awe! the streets look clean, the infra is good (not everywhere but in metro cities) and the education quality is pretty freaking awesome, they libraries are to die for! and much more! now, i am not fond of the ccp, to put it mildly, but i can't brush off the fact that they have pulled many of their citizens out of poverty and have created greater prosperity for them! when i look at china i get jealous, i feel like that could have been us. we have everything, better relations with the west (relatively), english speaking population, english as a medium of education, and connection to important waterways and we had a democracy and we were not fully communist, yet i see countries like vietnam and china outperforming us in some key metrics and i don't know what to make of it! i am not a supporter of bjp but i agree with the bjp when they say congress has much to answer for (although they haven't been great at bringing prosperity to india either). so, what happened guys? again, i want to reiterate, i am not a fan of the ccp, i know how china's culture changed after they took power. i have seen my cousins and friends be really desperate to go abroad and i don't like that we don't have much opportunities here in our own country. many chinese who go to work abroad actually come back willfully and try and help build their country up by the expertise they have gained in their host countries, i feel like it's not the same here in our country, people usually study abroad because they don't want to come back. edit: i haven't gotten any great answers, but from what i have gathered it has something to do with 1. not liberalizing our economy sooner. 2. trying to maintain strategic autonomy of one's own country by not aligning with either superpower (again, this is good, but a balance has to be struck between economy and strategic autonomy) 3. corruption 4. lack of quality education 5. tribal mindset: we're too divided among ourselves into sects, castes, religions, and races. unlike us, china has a monotonous population yes, i feel like there could be better answers. so... do speak more! give the bjp another 50 years and soon the next government will come and say the same thing that the bjp has much to answer for. i’ve been to china too and i saw the development. i grew up in singapore and had many friends who moved there from china during the 90s for a better life. now some of those same friends are moving back to china. see development can only happen in two ways. either the people demand for it or the government forces it. normally in a democracy, people are the ones who will demand. they will protest for change and constantly complain, make noise and put the government in their place when they make a mistake. this does not happen in india. people are very happy go lucky. they don’t care. the hunger here lies in areas such as religion. bjp saw this and took advantage of this. now they’ve created an environment where if you complain against them, you’re anti national so as if it wasn’t bad enough that people didn’t complain about development, now the few who actually care to complain for change, will get arrested. that’s why bjp is a dangerous government. neither is the bjp working towards development nor are they letting people talk about it. because talks of development means consistently criticising the government to keep pressure. instead, they are consistently playing the religious game. this is why we’ll never see a developed india in our lifetime. until or unless the people change or the government changes. the biggest problem that we have in imo is acknowledging that we do have problems. its okay for countries to have problems but we fail at the first smh there are a few problems for india as far as i can tell: 1. corruption: corruption is extremely widespread, and is the norm. getting anything done in india is not straightforward. sure there's corruption elsewhere as well, but in india it is on a few higher levels. 2. ism's: we love to discriminate. if it's not by race, it's by religion, caste, language. we are like spurs fans, we'd rather lose and not get champions league, and ensure arsenal does not win, rather than win, get champions league and in the process enable arsenal to win the league. i.e we'd rather fail and let the next guy fail, than succeed and let the next guy succeed 3. religion: in india religion is not private or personal. it is something for everyone to have a say and judge people's religions and faiths. religion takes a precedence over infrastructure and development. there’s this great book called games indians play by v raghunathan. pretty quick read. it analyses indians and our behavior from a game theory perspective under the lens of prisoner dilemma. indians essentially always “snitch” on each other, or we refuse to collaborate and rather throw each other under the bus. as a result we end up with a net negative sum effect on our society lack of honesty and empathy, those are the 2 major barriers for indians","A user asks 'Where did we go wrong?' comparing India to China/Vietnam.

(article) ---- many things have changed in india since narendra modi first became prime minister. but one change that has gone almost unnoticed is that a process of real decolonisation has transpired. and because of this the old, colonised ruling class has been swept away. this is a very good thing. it should have happened long, long ago. as someone who belonged to that ruling class, i consider myself well qualified to explain why this process of decolonisation was overdue and how we failed india as its ruling class. the truth is we were an effete, hopeless bunch. we spoke no indian language well, but this did not matter to us. we were proud of speaking english well. in our drawing rooms we sneered at those who dared enter without speaking good english. and at those whose table manners were not embellished with western refinement. in short, those who fumbled with forks and knives and preferred eating with their hands and without cutlery. when we travelled to foreign lands, we made a good pretense of being indian, but we never cared to understand what it meant to be indian. we pretended to know everything about india’s ancient culture and civilisation, but we knew almost nothing. in the schools and colleges we attended, we learned more about western civilisation, history, and literature than about our own, so it was not totally our fault. when it came to politics and elections, we stuck loyally by the nehru-gandhi dynasty and its various heirs because they were people like us. we did not care that parliament had been turned into a private members club. it was our club. nor did we care that the congress party under sonia gandhi’s stewardship had also become a private club. it was our club. in our drawing rooms we talked endlessly of democracy and secularism and saw ourselves as ordained to protect these ideas. then along came narendra modi and the earth shifted beneath our feet. he may not have been personally responsible for everything that changed but he was a vital part of the political change that happened, and this somehow became an essential element of the bigger changes that were happening. suddenly, almost overnight, after modi first became prime minister, we became not just powerless but irrelevant. a new breed of indians who spoke hindi well and english not at all started replacing us in the high offices of government, as political analysts, and anchors in tv studios, in journalism, in bollywood movies and tv series. they were not impressed with our skills in english, and we were so impressed by how indian they were that we tried to emulate them just to belong. some of us have succeeded, most of us have not. those who have not but wish to continue being relevant cling these days to rahul and priyanka gandhi and hope that somehow, they will be able to defeat modi. some act as advisors to the current heirs of the dynasty and fill their heads with grandiose ideas like saving the constitution and saving democracy. but the truth is that rahul gandhi’s main message remains the same as it was in the last general election. this is that modi is corrupt and that he works only for a handful of rich indians. he steals your money, he shrieks at his political rallies, and he gives it to his rich friends. how exactly does this work? as leader of the congress party, he is seen, especially by foreign correspondents, as the only man who can defeat modi. it is bad luck for him that he seems so incapable of convincing indian voters of this, despite trying hard to prove that he is one of them. he has worked with farmers in rice fields, transported coal on bicycles with miners, listened to the woes of vegetable sellers and spent long hours with mechanics in dingy shops to show how much he cares about the ‘common man.’ so why is the common man not impressed? could it be because these gestures come across somehow as noblesse oblige and not genuine acts of sympathy? what is it about ‘autocratic’, ‘dictatorial’ modi that attracts ordinary indian voters more? the answer that i got to this question on my recent travels in rural india is that people have seen changes in their lives, and they believe that these changes have happened because of modi. these are not remarkable changes. they are simple things like roads, drinking water, electricity, and internet services but because they were not there before, they seem remarkable. many of these things should have happened long ago. but because we were so colonised a ruling class, we did not notice that ordinary indians were forced to endure the worst public services. in our drawing rooms and in our entitlement, we did not care about such things because in our privileged cocoon it would have been unthinkable to go to a government hospital or a government school. modi’s advent burst the bubble in which we lived, and the truth is that most of us have no idea why this happened. we continue to hope that he will be defeated this time and hope that the message that democracy is in danger will resonate with voters. when the results come, we are likely to be disappointed again. i met nobody in rural india who saw modi as corrupt and autocratic. >what is it about ‘autocratic’, ‘dictatorial’ modi that attracts ordinary indian voters more?

1aw5qg0,"as economists and agricultural experts endorse the msp law, will the liberals take heed of the farmer's plight against propaganda? legal guarantee of msp is an idea whose time has come on 13 february 2024, over two years after the 2020-21 farmers movement was suspended, farmers prepared to march towards the delhi for their long-standing demands, including the legal guarantee of msp. samyukta kisan morcha had already called for a rural shutdown on february 16, after holding district level protests on 26 january, and mazdoor-kisan mahapadav on 26-27-28 november 2023. yet, in a replay of the 2020-21 farmer's movement, the administration dug trenches and erected layers of barricade and barbed wires to prevent the farmers from protesting in delhi. the police used tear gas, pellet guns, and sonic weapons against the farmers. drones were used to drop tear gas on the farmers. meanwhile, the government suspended the social media accounts of farmer's leader and journalists covering the protests. the government and the godi media launched a wave of propaganda against the farmers. the government began sending notes to media houses claiming that the demand of msp law is infeasible. news articles were published, quoting anonymous sources, that such a law would cost ₹10 lakh crore to the exchequer, would be larger than the infrastructure budget, would bankrupt the nation, etc. consent began to be manufactured among the public that the demand of msp law is a grave sin, demanded by anti-national, khalistani, farmers. even the liberal elite began to openly support this baseless claims. many began justifying the use of force against the protesting farmers. the arguments and the claims against msp, however, are disingenuous, and lack a proper understanding of agricultural or economic policy. to understand this, we need to understand the policy of msp, and the labour economy of india. in india, nearly half of the total workforce is engaged in agriculture and allied activities. of this, less than 0.5% of the farmers are large farmers. over 13% of the farmers are medium farmers, and nearly 87% are small and marginal farmers. a vast majority of the people are also landless farmers and farm labourers. income of the farmers has been stagnant for decades, and even declined. the harvest is prone to crop failures and price fluctuations. for a vast majority of the farmers, increasingly with time, agriculture isn't able provide a survival livelihood. with falling incomes and rising costs, farmers are pushed into debt and dying by suicide. in states like bihar, small farmers have migrated to other states, leaving the agriculture to women. others have to take up labour jobs to supplement their meagre income. at the same time, manufacturing jobs are declining, and workers are returning to the farms. agriculture serves as a safety net for the crores of people, who have fallen aside from the unequal development. farmers are working in the fields because they have no alternative. to suggest a transition from agriculture to manufacturing without creating jobs in the manufacturing sector is absurd. it is also important to note, that agriculture has a high growth elasticity of poverty, and an investment in agriculture can improve the lives and livelihood of crores of people in india. government of india declares msp for 23 crops based on the cost of cultivation estimates made by cacp. the msp is calculated based on a2+fl cost, against the c2 cost recommended by swaminathan commission. in practice, though, msp is only realized for rice and wheat crops, and only where apmc mandis are present. hence, for the farmers in bihar, where apmc law was repealed, msp exists only on paper. even where apmc mandis are available, farmers are forced to cultivate only rice and wheat, since they can get assured price for these crops. a legal guarantee of msp does not mean that the government would procure the entire harvest. nor is the procured harvest is a lost amount, since it supports the food security programs. a legal guarantee of msp is a protection against exploitation for the small farmers. it is a policy against the price fluctuations inherent in the cobweb model. it is the price of the produce determined by the labour theory. msp is the right of the farmers, just like minimum wages is for the workers or maximum retail price is for the consumers. **a legal guarantee of msp will ensure that farmers across the nation can get a minimum assured price for their produce, and not be exploited. it will benefit the farmers of bihar and uttar pradesh, where msp remains on paper, more than the farmers of punjab and haryana. it will also allow the farmers of punjab and haryana, the states which are facing soil degradation and groundwater depletion, to diversify their cropping pattern.** **more importantly, it will directly benefit crores of farmers across india. it will bring prosperity to the rural areas. it will prevent the migration crisis. it will prevent farmer's suicides.** crisil market intelligence & analytics estimates that the a legal guarantee of msp for 2023 marketing year would cost ₹21,000 crore, less than 0.5% of the union budget. it is noteworthy, that in the last five years, agriculture budget has declined from 5.44% of the total budget to 3.08% of the total budget. msp as a legal guarantee has been recommended by agricultural experts, economists. it has been a demand of the farmers for decades. it was recommended by swaminathan commission and, in 2011, was recommended by a panel led by then cm of gujarat narendra modi. it was one of the two key demands of all india kisan sangharsh coordination committee, a platform of over 200 farmer's unions and organizations. farmers had organized numerous marches and protests for the demand of msp. it was also one of the six demands during the 2020-21 farmer's movement, and one of the assurances given by the farmers by the union government.

1aqg77b,"are farm protest demands unrealistic? tldr: i have been through the demands of farmers and to me they seem impossible to fulfill. c2+50% and legal guarantee: my father spent his entire life in the agriculture sector ( first govt job and then farming) and from his experience, i can say this is impossible. c1 is the direct cost of production and c2 is the indirect cost -> msp is (c1+c2) *1.5. this formula is derived from the standpoint of input alone it does not consider the quality of the product and market forces. now the second part is only govt i.e. nafed purchases at msp and that too essential grains and pulses. rest is purchased by traders and that is usually determined by market forces and that price can range from 0.5x to 2x. for perishables, it can range from 0 – 10x. with nafed then the farmers are reluctant to take any risk. the thing about nafed is region there is a quota and the window opens typically in the harvest season and closes once the quota is fulfilled. now what happens when msp is enforced on traders? they would purchase only on a need-basis and the rest would be imported. the net outcome is that market supply will drop down significantly over the demand, meaning hyperinflation and unsold inventory with the farmer. now account for lower purchases due to quality issues and the prices of all food items would typically become 3-5x of the current prices. the biggest beneficiary will be the importer and an agrarian state like india will be import-dependent on food. now coming to the 50% profit part (which is tax-free), most traditional industries (steel, cement, transport, etc.) operate on a margin of ~5% and ~50% of their income is taken by the govt as tax. withdrawal from wto: now since this logic of global prices has been put forth in front of farmers the reason, we cannot put restrictions on imports that farmer organizations have demanded for the govt to withdraw from wto so that domestic prices are not affected by global markets and there would be no restrictions on subsidies. so basically 1.5x the selling price at 0 input cost. restriction of corporate sectors into agriculture: the govt has limitations on how much it can invest into agricultural reform and only the corporate sector can bring investment that can scale up to the entire landscape of india. pension for farmers: here some of the state govt is unable to pay existing employees' pensions, infrastructure development is done on borrowed money, now add the cost of excess msp from 1st point pension money. from where will the money come for farmers? withdraw electricity amendment bill: now the thing is with privatization the cost of electricity may increase. so no privatization of electricity. most state electricity boards are putting the state finances towards bankruptcy and there is no way this can be sustainable. none of the demand seems to be realistic. let me know your opinion. the biggest problem with agriculture in india right now is fragmentation. land sizes are too small to support decent incomes without subsidies and government funding. india is not rich enough to be able to afford this, it's as simple as that. problem is these kinda demands take money away from growth areas, which could've made more money in the future upa government themselves rejected the swaminathan commission suggestions. even then thy knew that its not feasible . any government that agrees for msp law then be ready for increase in taxes. at some point we have to deal with the reality that there's too many farmers for the amount of farming we do. as a one time necessary evil, some of them simply have to go out of business and seek alternative ways of contributing to the economy. it sounds callous but these things happen in every other industry. this is why we don't have any jobs in the cd manufacturing field or typewriting. those people struggled for a generation and found other things to do. they got phased out. a lot of archaic farming practices need to be phased out but because of emotional value of farming govt is continuously intervening trying to keep the market unchanged and we are bleeding money and innovation because of it. they are blackmailing the country. 10 lakh crore every year? why? are their blood more valuable than others? the logic that they are annadata is so backward. has anyone ever gotten a free meal by farmers? if they aren't making money, move to other sectors. most of the country is poor. we also need doctors. should doctors be on street demanding 20 lakh per annum? india needs to move away from agrarian society. none of these demands can ever be entertained. they want everyone else to suffer for them.","A detailed post argues that farmer demands (C2+50%, MSP Law, WTO withdrawal) are unrealistic and impossible to fulfill.

1aqd3uf,"when farmers stood up **part 1: when farmers stood up** in 2014, narendra modi came to power with the promise of msp at c2+50% for the farmers, and ending the agricultural crisis in india. as cm, modi had recommended a legal guarantee of msp, and promised pension for farmers in his manifesto for 2014 general election. yet, the farmers were betrayed. the budget allocation to agriculture fell, and agricultural growth slowed down. the government made it difficult to declare droughts. agricultural income fell and indebtedness increased. meanwhile, the government kept on repeating the promise of doubling farmer's income, without even a concrete plan or policy. in 2017, the shivraj singh chauhan government in madhya pradesh shot dead 6 farmers who were protesting for their demands. to fight against the growing attacks on the farmers, farm organizations and unions united under the banner all india kisan sangharsh coordination committee (aikscc). aikscc had two key demands. first, a legal guarantee of minimum support price (msp) using the comprehensive cost formula as recommended by swaminathan commission. second, freedom from indebtedness, through a one-time comprehensive loan waiver, to end the farmer's suicides. aikscc led numerous protests and long marches for the fulfilment of these demands, which were conveniently ignored by the government. on 5 june 2020, when india was reeling under the covid-19 pandemic, the modi government used this crisis as an opportunity (aapada me awasar) to bring three farm laws as an ordinance. these laws, related to apmc mandi, contract farming, and hoarding of grains, were brought in a conspiracy with corporates, to allow a corporate takeover of agriculture and drive farmers off their land. at this time, agriculture in india was already going through a crisis. due to falling incomes and increasing debt, farmers were dying by suicide. farmers had organized numerous protests and march against the anti-farmer policies. these protests were forcefully crushed by the government and ignored by the mainstream media. aikscc wrote to the prime minister against the three ordinances, and organized protests throughout july and august. yet, these pleas fell on deaf ears. meanwhile, protests against the three ordinances intensified in punjab and haryana. aikscc gave the call of “delhi chalo” on 26-27 november 2020. this was supposed to be a two-day protest. yet, even before the march began, several farm leaders were detained and put under house arrest. the government dug trenches on the borders of delhi, and put nails and barbed wires. tear gas and water cannons were used to prevent the farmers from reaching the capital, and protest in ramlila maidan. the farmers decided to sit in protest and camped where they could. to coordinate their protest, farm unions formed the samyukta kisan morcha (skm). the two-day protest of farmers turned into a 12-month long nationwide movement. throughout the freezing winter and scorching summer, lakhs of farmers sat in protests at the borders of delhi, while an intense and widespread movement spread across india. after initially refusing to talk to the farmers, the government held 11 rounds of talks with the skm. skm had settled on a list of six demands, which included the repeal of the three farm laws and the legal guarantee of msp. the government used all kinds of measures to crush the movement. the government and its propaganda media, tried to castigate the protesters by calling them pakistani, khalistani, naxalite, maoist, and andolanjeevi. bjp sent its goons to attack the protest sites and provoke the protesters, while police stayed as a mute spectator. numerous cases were filed against the farmers. nearly 800 farmers died during the protests. in lakhimpur kheri, ashish mishra teni, son of a bjp minister, mowed down six farmers to their death. in spite of all oppression, the farmers remained resolute, and their non-violent movement persisted. on 19 november 2021, pm modi announced to repeal the three laws. yet, other demands were still pending. farmers had led a year-long movement, but were only back to the situation which existed before june 2020. further deliberations took place between the skm and the government. on 9 december 2021, sanjay agarwal, secretary of department of agriculture and farmer's welfare, gave a written assurance to the farmers, with a list of five promises, including a legal guarantee of msp, withdrawal of cases registered against the farmer, compensation to the martyrs of the movement, and urged them to suspend their movement. the farmer's movement was suspended on 11 december 2021. you can’t expect freebies and subsidies at the cost of tax payers you get it we pay taxes on income we are tired of seeing that getting spend on these stupid stunts, these so called farmers disrupt the life of common man in delhi and nearby places you can’t expect government to sit idle in that scenario. enough of this drama build houses for everyone. no one should be homeless. make sure everyone has nutritious food. have education and healthcare facilities available for everyone, regardless of income. all these three must be given to everyone unconditionally, whether they work hard or not is irrelevant. as long as those are granted, the government should not have more responsibilities towards the public. govt already runs a big account deficit. these things won't be possible without a bigger economy. doesn't help that india cannot get cheap loans like a lot of other countries. none of the arguments actually hold up as its been proven repeatedly that doing all of them is cheaper than not doing them. you cannot just print money dude. you need capital to do those things at large scale. social housing is already being done at the state level in lot of places, same with universal healthcare. it just takes time. for example my native state odisha had 80% poverty rate, its down to now 23% and extensive family planning has helped to stabilize the population making it a net tax contributor. as a result the state itself was able to privde low income housing and social housing in cities and with the help of center its trying to do the same in rural areas. whereas places like bihar and wb had uprecendented population growth and its still growing fast, the state over there can barely feed people properly and infra likely won't catch up. the things you mentioned is not that easy to do under such kind of stress on budgets.","Part 1 of 'When Farmers Stood Up', detailing

19delav,"can somebody fact check these points about ayodhya ram mandir? one of my friends has put this as their instgram story and i am very sure that he did not write all of these on his own. i want to know how many of these are actually true because i saw a youtube video by akash banarjee (deshbhakt) where he said that there was no major historical record of a ram mandir of significance importance being demolished to build a babri masjid. i just want to know how much of it is actually true and how much of it is propoganda. some facts are true, and some aren't. as tourism of ayodhya is definitely gonna rise in the following days ahead, more investments like apartments, residences, hotels, restaurants etc, have come up. not sure about the amount of money invested coz different sources claim varying amounts of investments, but the overall infra and economy will rise anyways. about the asi survey, there were found some buried pillars and other statues, which had inscriptions with vedic and ancient kinds of carvings. it didn't clearly show any signs of existing ram mandir, but it was unobvious that it was related to islam or babur. so, it was concluded that it was hindu or at least indic in origin. but, the specific claims like ""lal pillars"", mughal inscriptions etc might not be fully accurate or viable. four main points 1) artifacts were found under the masjid 2) foreign travellers have independently written about existence of some temple, pre and post demolition of temple 3) hindus continued worshipping there even at the makeshift. muslims stopped reading namaz. 4) hindu scriptures talks about it the history part i'll leave for someone else to look at. but the projections are all just numbers thrown in the air. as an investment banker it is literally our job to create selling points with some vague data. i'd take that with a bucket of salt. ayodhya will see some investments etc but in 10 years i would not be surprised if an metric of employment , wages etc remain pretty much same or in line with inflation. i recommend you to watch interview of kk mohammed on lallantop oe you can read the book the battle for rama (case of the temple at ayodhya) by meenakshi jain for proof . the part about investment is true because why not it's a major religious pilgrimage site. rest of it is projection with may of may not be true. the fate of ayodhya might change if we are talking about cleanliness and aesthetics. roads would be widened, streets would be cleaned, lighting would be taken care of! more railway services might be announced, metro network would be developed soon...! all good! the hospitality industry might take some time, but it's definitely gonna get a boost. how much? i'm not sure about the numbers. fate of ayodhya-waasis however isn't gonna change overnight drastically. the money flows where you create wealth. hospitality industries, eateries, stalls, restaurants, hotels etc are gonna get the big bucks. even 10 years down the line, that's marginal improvement in both taxes to the state govt and revenue generation. make my trip, irctc, railways, air india, indigo, vistara are the real beneficiaries! temple trust is the beneficiary. the people? nope. ayodhya won't suddenly become ramnagari overnight and outperform lucknow, kanpur or varanasi or prayagraj, or ghaziabad and noida! nope. if that had been the case, every temple town on india were prosperous or atleast the largest contributor to state exchequer! but that isn't the case is it? tirupati isn't the crowned jewel of andhra pradesh! neither is amritsar to punjab's economy! neither is shrdi or nashik to maharashtra's state economy! rameshwaram, kodaikanal, madurai to tn, but no! benefits are gonna accrue as they always do. but the magnitude which media is trying to peddle is sheer stupid! it's never as expected sadly. there are gonna be massive crowds, but the beneficiaries atleast the tangible ones apart from spiritual experiences of million adherents, are few! it's always has been the case. travel agents and small business flourishing there are gonna be the real deal. and that too, if they happened to be ayodhya-waasis! if outsider were to establish shops there, the people there aren't gonna get nothing! these things take time. let media and state govt throw random numbers to you, but that doesn't mean shit!","User asks for a fact-check on Ayodhya claims (historic temple demolition, etc.).

19e4dxs,"question for those that support/like the ram mandir: what does it mean to you? a lot of people i knew in the past and follow on social media have been 'celebrating' the consecration of the ram mandir, something i am ideologically opposed to. i'm not entirely surprised, but i'm finding it harder to process because while it's clearly a political event, they don't seem to see it as such. so, if you felt good about the ceremony on 22nd january, and celebrated it, what did it mean to you? is it just a slightly more orange diwali or something else? do you think the demolition of the babri masjid was a good thing? if not, how do you reconcile feeling good about the mandir built on it? some factual ground rules we can follow (you can dispute this but it would be hard to): 1. the destruction of the babri masjid was illegal and happened while india was an independent secular constitutional democracy, if an illegal act did not occur, it would still be there. 2. the ram janmbhoomi movement was a political move by the bjp, and did result in a great deal of communal strife and violence and contributed to enmity between hindus and muslims, which the bjp benefits from to this day. 3. the prime minister of india could have been in attendance, but to be the one leading the consecration ceremony is wrong. he is the leader of a secular democracy and should not be performing the duties of a religious leader. any number of great hindu priests could have done this in his stead. so would it be fair if the tribals of central india reclaimed all the adani and vedanta mines to reclaim the colonization and invasion of their indigenous lands? a great ram temple could've been made in ayodhya. one that was not stained by the blood of innocents and the destruction of another place of worship. i would have liked to go to that one. dont bother, the guy is a lunatic. by that logic indian muslims are indigenous to india. so are indian christians and jews. ethnicity is important to being indigenous, not religion. actually, though: most indians aren't indigenous. around 8 to 10% are. an early form of what we now call hinduism, including an early form of sanskrit, came to india via migration from central asia. buddhism, having originated in bihar, had its places of worship destroyed by hindu kings and turned into temples. badrinath for example in uttarakhand was built after destroying a buddhist monastery. i don't see you rallying for that anytime soon. you just jumped several logical hoops there immersed as you were in devotion to lord ram. first, babur himself in his chronicles never recorded destroying a temple in ayodhya and is known to have come only 15 km closest to this area. archaeological evidence was so weak for a temple beneath the masjid that even the gogoi led bench had to set it aside andappeal to some twisted logic to award the land to the hindus. if you follow the history of the dispute you will see that at first a portion in one corner was considered the birthplace that slowly advanced to being right under the dome. so clearly no one knew for sure. also this whole mischief started with the british in 1858 who clearly saw a path into awadh province by dividing its population. so congratulations for championing the idea you should be knighted by the king pretty soon.","A question to Mandir supporters: 'What does it mean to you?'.

1anhaxj,"discussion - how would vivekananda view the ramjanmabhoomi movement and ram mandir? actual article : [ recently, i came across an article in frontline about vivekananda's hypothetical perspective of ramjanmabhoomi movement. i should state that i have never read swami vivekananda before and this post has lot of his words quoted which seemed like a breath of fresh air. one quote that really resonated with me is below: >asked in an interview by an american reporter what exactly about religion he was teaching, vivekananda replied, “it is really the philosophy of religion, the kernel of all its outward forms. all forms of religion have an essential and a non-essential part. if we strip from them the latter, there remains the real basis of all religion, which all forms of religion possess in common. unity is behind them all. we may call it god, allah, jehovah, the spirit, love; it is the same unity that animates all life, from its lowest form to its noblest manifestation in man. it is on this unity that we need to lay stress, whereas… it is on the non-essential that men are apt to lay stress. they will fight and kill each other for these forms, to make their fellows conform. seeing that the essential is love of god and love of man, this is curious, to say the least.” i would like to know from the people who have read vivekananda about their opinion on this article. does author represents vivekananda correctly? also, please suggest me some of his readings. disclaimer: i am an atheist who is generally interested in hindu mythology and its origins. would not be invited to bjp events. then swamiji (swami vivekananda) said that on the way back he returned to srinagar by the common route by which the pilgrims return. a few days after returning to srinagar, he went to visit kshir bhavani devi and staying there for seven days worshipped the devi and made homa to her with offerings of kshira (condensed milk). every day he used to worship the devi with a maund of kshira as offering. one day, while worshipping, the thought arose in swamiji's mind: ""mother bhavani has been manifesting her presence here for untold years. the mohammedans came and destroyed her temple, yet the people of the place did nothing to protect her. alas, if i were then living i could never have borne it silently."" when, thinking in this strain, his mind was much oppressed with sorrow and anguish, he distinctly heard the voice of the mother saying, ""it was according to my desire that the mohammedans destroyed this temple. it is my desire that i should live in a dilapidated temple, otherwise, can i not immediately erect a seven - storeyed temple of gold here if i like? what can you do? shall i protect you or shall you protect me!"" swamiji said, ""since hearing that divine voice, i cherish no more plans. the idea of building maths etc. i have given up; as mother wills, so it will be."" from ""the complete works of swami vivekananda, volume 7"" he would view with extreme disgust our current state of affairs. if you are familiar with his writings , we are doing the exact opposite today. definitely not for that temple inauguration how do you get money by helping the poor.","Discussion on how Vivekananda would view the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.

1934q75,"manipur government denies permission to rahul gandhi’s bharat jodo nyay yatra rally manipur me abi b govt hai ? manipur gobermint: bharat todo yatra on the other hand we will approve. the yatra will begin from manipur on january 14, travelling 6200 km across 14 states, to reach mumbai on march 20. the yatra, which will focus on the issues of unemployment and inflation, as well as social and economic justice, comes at the crucial moment ahead of the 2024 general election. the bjp intends to fight the 2024 election on the issue of ram mandir. the party is trying to use its communal agenda to influence the voters in north india. congress' bharat nyay yatra can provide an effective counter to bjps communal agenda in this region. north india has a large youth population suffering from massive unemployment. the youth are disillusioned and angered by the policies of the modi government. their ire turned into arson when the agitators targeted the bjp offices during agnipath protests. the recent security incident in parliament is another reminder of the crisis unfolding in india. congress' bharat nyay yatra is a brilliant move that can change the narrative of the 2024 general election. the experience of bharat jodo yatra shows that such a movement can help bring the issues of the common people into popular discourse. even the mainstream media is unable to ignore such a movement. bharat jodo yatra received overwhelming support from the common people, and stands as a testimony to the fact that bjp's narrative can be successfully countered. bharat nyay yatra is a commendable movement that must be wholeheartedly supported.

1cn0qvv,"rahul gandhi and fighting a political battle on one's own terms on 22 january 2024, as prime minister set out for ram mandir consecration, the ruling party used entire state, media, and political apparatus to turn the religious even into a political campaign. his propaganda media hailed it as a ""renaissance"", a ""historic day"", a beginning of ram rashtra. the union government cabinet hailed it as a true freedom, undermining the long fought freedom of 1947. the propaganda media was particularly scathing in its attacks on congress for turning down the invitation. at the same time, rahul gandhi was travelling across the country meeting lakhs of common people in his bharat jodo nyay yatra. the yatra was also heavily derided by many. yet, the former congress president stayed on his course, refusing to follow the communal politics and raising the issues of livelihood and justice. nyay or justice became the watchword of the two yatras that spanned the length and breadth of the india. throughout the yatras, rahul gandhi continued to meet thousands of youths, workers, farmers, and the marginalised classes. at the same time, congress was hit by a series of defections, dwindling funds, and immense pressure from a media which had declared the elections a foregone conclusion, and the politics of hindutva an undeniable fact. yet, congress refused to tow their agenda. in april, congress unveiled its election manifesto with a focus on youth, women, workers, farmers, and the backward classes. for a nation reeling under crises of unemployment, inequality, and injustice, congress' pro-people plank was a breath of fresh air. unsurprisingly, in his patented style, modi went on a communal diatribe to call congress manifesto as a muslim league manifesto. he went from rallies to rallies, alleging that congress wants to steal women's mangalsutra, wealth, buffaloes, etc. he claimed that congress wanted to destroy ram mandir. fearing a possibility of defeat, the ruling party went further into a communal hatemongering campaign. yet, with congress refusing to join its chorus, bjp stands alone and adrift. following congress' campaign against assault on constitution and social justice, bjp itself was forced on the backfoot. with modi's recent comments against adani and ambani, one thing is certain, rahul gandhi has managed to force narendra modi to play on his terms. india has, for the time being, been saved from the political agenda of hindutva. well said. now modixi is left with nothing - no manifesto and no agenda - so he is left to slinging poop and it is mostly falling on himself. individual is not on pedestal, and i only support him because he is aligned with my political agenda. yet, it is important to recognize the determination of the individual to fight a battle where many have made easy compromise. in 10 years, we'll see push and pull of same issues as people refuse to move on from identity politics and putting an individual on pedestal. support should be of ideas not a person, dhruv rathee as an individual has done much more damage to namo than raga even though dhruv's resources are limited. despite being a credible opponent dhruv can't contest and win elections in congress because congress will oppose him like they are doing to priyanka gandhi to keep one man at forefront it is this worshipping of one man and one family which has led to india in such a sad state that in a country of 140cr people, we can't say that 543 mps will put forward views of 543 constituencies in the parliament, these 543 people have no connection with people, everyone wants to vote for rahul or modi","Analysis of Rahul Gandhi fighting on his own terms.

1clf1zu,"quarterly transparency report for january-march 2024: censorship, surveillance, smartcities and more | internet freedom foundation &#x200b; ## tl;dr in 2023, iff’s transparency vertical filed 64 rti applications with various public authorities at the state and union levels to bring transparency and accountability into the functioning of a number of public authorities, and empower indian citizens with information that affects their digital rights. some notable responses from this quarter include a push-and-pull with mib on comments it received in the broadcasting services (regulation) bill, 2023, stonewalling of information on censorship and content blocking/takedown orders from the government, more non-transparency into the digi yatra ecosystem, the poshan app being non-mandatory, and more. ## why should you care? the right to information act, 2005 (“rti act”) was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of public authorities by ensuring that citizens are able to secure access to information in control of these authorities. facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting in private interests. where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision-making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities. the rti act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with, and demand transparency and accountability from, our union and state governments. the digital transparency vertical at iff strives to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects introduced in the public sector through rti applications filed under the act. responses we receive often pave the way for government engagement, advocacy, and even strategic litigation. previous reports on our transparency endeavours can be accessed [here]( ## rtis we filed here is a list of rtis we filed this quarter: 1. on november 23, 2023 the department of personnel and training published a notification bearing reference number g.s.r 864(e), placing the indian computer emergency response team (“cert-in”) under the second schedule of the rti act—thereby exempting it from the application of the act. in an attempt to have more transparency on the legislative processes involved in notifying a public authority under this schedule, we filed 8 [rtis]( this quarter asking the department for legislative process and history of 8 exempted intelligence and security agencies (including cert-in). read our statement on how exempting cert-in from the rti act dilutes institutional transparency and weakens individual privacy [here]( 2. we [asked]( the ministry of electronics & it (“meity”) detailed questions about the whatsapp message sent from the ‘viksit bharat sampark’ account to millions of users, including where they got our numbers from. read

section 79(3)(b) of the information technology act, 2000, including the national crime records bureau and recently the indian cyber crime coordination centre. 3. we [asked]( the gujarat state revenue department about a notification they issued introducing aadhaar verification for registration of documents under gujarat registration rules, 2023. 4. we [asked]( about the legal framework behind the lawless automated permanent academic account registry (“apaar”) student id. 5. in context of the farmers’ protests again, we [asked]( about the use of drones for surveillance of protesters by the

and safeguards for interception, monitoring and decryption of information) rules 2009 on february 26, 2024 vide gsr 133(e), allowing certain security agencies to destroy interception records. we [asked]( meity about interministerial communications it received in response to the amendment. 10. we [asked]( the election commission about their partnership with staqu technologies pvt ltd as is claimed on the latter’s website. ## round-up of prominent responses we tracked policy consultations, news headlines, and emerging government schemes to make measured rti interventions on a number of concerning initiatives. here are some key responses we received to our rtis this year, along with a summary of outcomes that emerged from them: ### the broadcasting bill files in november 2023, the mib published the [draft broadcasting services (regulation) bill]( for public consultation. on december 07, 2023, we submitted [our comments]( on the bill, and launched the [letuschill.in]( campaign, encouraging our community to also send in templatised email responses as comments for the bill. following this, on february 23, 2024, we [wrote a letter]( to mib requesting the publication of all received comments on the ministry's website, with personal information redacted. simultaneously, we filed an [rti application]( with mib, seeking details and copies of the consultation responses. then, things got interesting. on march 01, 2024, mib sent an email to us and other stakeholders who submitted comments, saying they have received rti requests to disclose their comments, requesting them to give consent for the same within 10 days. we promptly provided our consent as iff, and sent a mailer to our community explaining the process to them and encouraging them to give their consent with personal details redacted, if they so prefer. thereafter, we received an [rti response]( from mib through which they made some interesting arguments. first, they claimed that the comments submitted by stakeholders cannot be disclosed without their consent as that would violate their privacy and intellectual property rights. despite this, mib requested a sum of rs. 934 from us to send us copies of the 417 comments it could make public. we duly paid the sum and now await their response. additionally, alongside this process on march 04, 2024, [we reiterated]( the necessity of transparently sharing all consultation responses, urging the redaction of personal details before publication. we await movement on this and will keep you posted. ### what happens in ayodhya… in our ongoing efforts to gather comprehensive information surrounding the ram temple ceremony in ayodhya on january 22, 2024, we filed 4 rti requests with different departments, seeking details and procedures associated with the widespread ai-enabled surveillance and security measures being adopted in the city (as described above). the [response]( from the dgp, up was particularly noteworthy, as they shared a copy of the standard operating procedure (sop) used by the up police during the ceremony. this document may hold some valuable insights into the protocols and strategies adopted by the local police—we are currently in the process of meticulously analysing the sop and will publish it shortly. ### don’t ask, don’t tell: censorship edition in all our efforts to get information on content censorship, takedowns, and blocking across farmers’ protests, caravan story takedown, media blocking and constitution of fact-check units, we got comparable tight-lipped responses. the trifecta of section 69a (information technology act), rule 16 (information technology rules), and 8(1)(a) of the rti act was used liberally in response. we await responses on some of these and will be collating these findings in a censorship report shortly, deeply analysing these responses and identifying trends. ### daastan-e-digiyatra we sought information on the data ecosystem and operations of digi yatra with regional airports in december 2023, but the responses lacked information and clarity. ministry of civil aviation and airports authority of india stated that digi yatra is not mandatory (though the story on ground is [different]( and the bengaluru international airport limited (“bial”) [stated]( that whether bial is a public authority and therefore under the rti act is still “sub-judice” (being decided by a court of law). ### don’t act smart(city) with me! because of the recent surge and deployment of artificial intelligence in the public sector, especially in smart city initiatives, we filed a bunch of rtis with the different ministries and departments. but as usual, received little to no information in return. iff has built an ai/ml tracker transparency tracker on the use of ai/ml in the indian public sector (we will make this public soon!), which goes to show the extent of non-transparency and accountability evasion in this domain. ### poshan tracker not mandatory we filed 3 separate rtis with the ministry of women and child development last year in the context of the poshan tracking application regarding beneficiary concerns, anganwadi and health worker concerns (if it is mandatory and if they are being provided with any technical training), collecting and tracking data of children with disabilities and asking if there is privacy impact assessment and a cost-benefit analysis instituted for the poshan app. one [response]( (which came many months late!) stated that the poshan app is not mandatory for anganwadi workers and that technical training of anganwadi workers on the app is done on a regular basis through the national e-governance division and national institute of public corporation and child development. they also mentioned that poshan is not used to track attendance, or at least mandatorily. lastly, they noted that the privacy impact assessment and a cost-benefit analysis are points under “active consideration”. ### the apaar trouble we have filed a host of rtis with the ministry of education about the seemingly lawless apaar id which is being implemented at breakneck speed across india, only to receive mind-numbing responses. we will soon release a detailed analysis of our transparency efforts around apaar in a separate post. ### eci’s big secret? we filed an rti with the election

1aoy07y,"budget session 2024: a digital rights review [ ## tl;dr both houses of the parliament were adjourned sine die on february 10, 2024, concluding the 2024 budget session one day after the scheduled end date of february 09, and the last parliamentary session for the 17th lok sabha. during this session, 10 new bills were introduced for passing, of which 12 were passed by both houses, 1 pending passage in the rajya sabha, with a total of 24 bills pending after the conclusion of the session. the union interim budget for 2024-25 was presented and passed. we see increased budgetary allocations in the budget for meity, mha, mib and dot as compared to the 2023-2024 budget, which is a good starting point for building and implementing robust digital systems. discussions on the floor of the parliament spanned several issues, including those relevant to digital rights and freedoms. ## background the 15th parliamentary session of the 17th lok sabha was adjourned sine die on february 10, 2024, concluding one day after the scheduled end date of february 09. this marks the last parliamentary sitting for the 17th lok sabha, as we prepare to elect a new government in the upcoming general elections. in the session, union minister nirmala sitharaman presented the union interim budget for the financial year (“fy”) 2024-2025, which was passed in both houses. the budget is an interim allocation of funds until india forms a new union government in the 2024 lok sabha elections, post which a full budget will be placed in both houses for deliberation again in july 2024. a cumulative sum of ₹1,43,337.88 cr has been allotted to the ministry of electronics and information technology (meity), the ministry of information and broadcasting (mib), the department of telecommunications (dot), and ministry of home affairs (mha). see our detailed analysis of the budget for these ministries in [this blogpost]( both houses introduced 10 bills, passed 12 and withdrew none. the bills passed in both houses and now awaiting presidential assent include the finance bill, 2024 which gives effect to tax proposals of the central government for the year 2024-25 and 5 appropriation bills. the other bills passed are the water (prevention and control of pollution), amendment bill, 2024, public examination (prevention of unfair means) bill, 2024, jammu and kashmir local bodies laws (amendment) bill, 2024, constitution (scheduled tribes) order (amendment) bill, 2024, constitution (scheduled castes and scheduled tribes) orders (amendment) bill, 2024, constitution (jammu and kashmir) scheduled castes order (amendment) bill, 2023; constitution (jammu and kashmir) scheduled tribes order (amendment) bill, 2023. read more about this session’s legislative business [here]( the lok sabha and rajya sabha observed productivity rates of 148% and 137% respectively. however, a majority of their time (44-47%) was spent discussing non-legislative business, and a fraction of time (8-9%) actually went into discussing and answering questions. while the union interim budget was passed after 7 hours 6 minutes of discussion in the lok sabha and 6 hours 37 minutes discussion in the rajya sabha, both houses spent between 3-5 hours discussing agenda item 'historic construction of shree ram temple and pran pratishta' on the final day of the parliament. these statistics are available [here]( and [here]( ## quick overview: union interim budget 2024-25 union interim budget for fy 2024-25 has cumulatively allotted ₹1,43,337.88 cr to the ministry of electronics and information technology (meity), the ministry of information and broadcasting (mib), the department of telecommunications (dot), and ministry of home affairs (mha). a glance at ministry-wise budget estimates (“be”) and revised estimates (“re”) shows us that for the meity, allocation in be 2024-2025 (₹21,385.15 cr) saw an increase of 48.28% as compared to the re of 2023-24 (₹14,421.25 cr); for the mha, allocation in be 2024-2025 (₹5733.51 crores) saw an increase of 11.97% as compared to the re of 2023-24 (₹5120.78 cr), for the mib, allocation in be 2024-2025 (₹4342.55 cr) saw a decrease of 2.41% as compared to the re of 2023-24 (₹4449.76 cr), for the dot, allocation in be 2024-2025 (₹1,11,876.67 cr) saw an increase of 13.74% as compared to the re of 2023-24 (₹98,359.41 cr). an enormous 17.15% increase in total planned capital expenditure of dot, meity, mha, and mib (₹1,43,337.88 cr) over the re of 2023-24 (₹1,22,351.2 cr) can be observed, stemming largely from a 48.28% increase in the ministry of electronics and information technology (meity). the increment can be attributed to meity’s capital allocation towards the modified programme for development of semiconductors and display manufacturing ecosystem in india, which saw a whopping 359.1% increase as compared to 2023-24. ## ministry-wise overview 1. **meity:** the total budgetary allocation for meity in the budget for 2024-2025 is ₹21385.2 cr, which is a 29.2% increase from the previous financial year’s budget. the increase is even higher when compared to the re of 2023-2024, i.e., a year-on-year change of 48.28%. this is in contrast to the budgetary trends we witnessed in 2021, 2022 and 2023, where there was underutilisation of the budget. &#x200b; * **dot**: in 2024-25, the department (which operates under the ministry of communications) has been allocated a whopping ₹111876.6 cr, which is 14.65% increase over the budget allocated in 2023-24 (₹97579.05 cr) and 13.74% over the re for 2023-24 (₹98359.41 cr). notably, no funds have been allocated for the defence spectrum, for which dot estimated a large amount of ₹2285.32 cr last year, but utilised only 13.8% of it (₹315.55 cr). &#x200b; * **mib:** the total budgetary allocation for mib in 2024-25 is ₹4342.55 cr, which is a 7.45% decrease from the 2023-2024 budget. this cut comes after mib seemingly was able to utilise a higher budget allocation last year, which seems incongruent. the allocation for central sector schemes/projects under mib has plateaued as compared to the be 2023-2024. &#x200b; * **mha:** the total budgetary allocation for mha is 2.84% lower than what was allocated in the be for the fy 2023-24. the allocation in the budget estimates, net of receipts and recoveries, for mha is ₹5733.51 cr. although there is a 11.97% increase over the 2023-24 re that was pegged at ₹5120.78 cr, the allocation is still 13.22% lower than what was made in 2023-24. the allocation for planned capital expenditure has marginally dipped as compared to both the 2023-2024 be ( by 1.27%) and re (by 6.21%), which is disappointing. ## questions, answers, and discussions ### digi yatra implementation and data security on february 05, niranjan reddy asked the ministry of civil aviation in the rajya sabha for insights on passenger data collection via digi yatra, measures taken to prevent unauthorised access/misuse, and whether passengers have visibility and control over their data, incl right to access, rectify & delete data, as well as the ministry’s plans to place digi yatra under govt oversight for enhanced security and transparency. the minister of state answered that the digiyatra central ecosystem prioritises privacy by design and default and all personal passenger data is stored locally in the passenger’s smartphone wallet itself. he added that data is shared with the origin airport for id validation and purged within 24 hrs post-flight departure, and that the government ensures data security and process transparency in digi yatra by maintaining passenger data locally only and purging it from the central system. however, this does not solve a central issue with digiyatra, which lacks transparency in its data flow and sharing practices, with vague privacy policy provisions and discrepancies in officials' statements. neither its nodal authority nor auditing body, which is the indian computer emergency response team (“cert-in”) falls under the rti act. read iff’s detailed analysis on digi yatra [here]( ### regulation of deepfakes on february 05, parliamentarian harbhajan singh asked meity if it is cognizant of the risks associated with disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence (“ai”) and deepfakes, and their plans to enact regulations in these domains. minister of state replied that the government’s internet policies prioritise an open, safe and accountable online space for all “digital nagriks”, and that they plan to leverage the potential of ai for innovation across sectors while being mindful of its risks, especially in the case of deepfakes. he stated that as for regulation the it (intermediary guidelines and digital media ethics code) rules, 2021 (“it rules, 2021”) obligate intermediaries to promptly address misinformation, which includes deepfakes. under these rules certain grievance appellate committees are set up to ensure a user-friendly redressal, and the ministry adopts a zero-tolerance stance on deepfakes which mandates platforms to align their terms of use and swiftly remove prohibited content. he added that recent advisories of the ministry emphasise compliance with it rules, 2021 for intermediaries, while users are being informed about content guidelines and potential legal consequences. the national cyber crime reporting portal and helpline are also available for grievance redress. as deepfakes took centre stage in 2023, meity decided to tackle the issue head-on. however, what ensued was several conflicting statements from meity and rushed interventions without deeply understanding or consulting over the issues, which is not the best-suited response to systemic issues like deepfakes. read iff’s analysis on this issue [here]( further, grievance appellate committees are not the solution to the problem – they worryingly make the government an arbiter of permissible speech on the internet and incentivise social media platforms and intermediaries to suppress any speech unpalatable to the government. read more of iff’s work on gacs under the it rules, 2021 [here]( ### internet and child mental health on february 02, in lok sabha, parliamentarian shashi tharoor asked the ministry of women and child development about their awareness of surveys done on the mental health concerns prevalent among internet-using children, and steps taken to address the issue, especially by the kerala government where the rates are worryingly high. minister of state answered that the government does not know of the survey, but studies have been done by the national commission for protection of child rights on the effects of mobile phone and internet usage on school children which suggest similar trends. she added that the government addresses mental health burden in children through the national mental health programme and rashtriya kishor swasthya karyakram, focused on holistic adolescent development with mental health as a key area. this is supported by the ayushman bharat school health and wellness programme and a national tele mental health programme with 34 states/uts already offering tele-mental health services, handling over 6,28,000 calls. ### rural connectivity and digital panchayats on february 06, in lok sabha,parliament damore guman asked the ministry of panchayati raj about their plans for technological advancements in panchayati raj institutions (“pri”), status of ftth internet connectivity in pris in madhya pradesh, how long until remaining gram panchayats have internet access, and the ministry’s efforts to raise digital literacy among newly elected representatives. minister of state replied that egramswaraj app enhances transparency in panchayat governance, with 2.52l pris uploading development plans and 2.41l completing online transactions for grants. auditonline ensures accountable finances, with 2.49l audit plans created. he added that bharatnet aims to connect all pris with broadband and 2,14,300 are presently service-ready. a ‘model panchayat citizens charter’ ensures timely services for citizens, and over 2.32l gram panchayats have conducted gram sabha to facilitate this. on digital literacy efforts, he stated that the revamped rashtriya gram swaraj abhiyan empowers panchayats through technical training for elected representatives, focusing on governance capabilities and sdg localisation at grassroots level. ### regulatory scope of dpdpa on february 07, in lok sabha, parliamentarian tenkasi asked meity about the key objectives of digital personal data protection (“dpdp”) act 2023, its impact on personal data processing in india, and its scope to advance india's ai adoption while safeguarding personal data. further, he asked how the government is ensuring companies comply with redressal mechanisms and penalties under the act, what steps are being taken to educate citizens about their statutory rights and what measures are in place to ensure compliance by data fiduciaries. minister of state answered that the dpdp act focuses solely on protection of personal data & establishes rights and duties of data principals and obligations of data fiduciaries – including safeguarding personal data against breaches & fostering responsible data processing practices. he added that the act establishes a data protection board to penalise non-compliance, ensuring accountability and imposing fines on processors violating data protection standards and that a transition period of 6-12 mos will be provided for them to adapt and comply to the new regime. the dpdp act in its current form is flawed on many aspects – it makes personal data vulnerable to online scraping, has weak notice requirements, gives sweeping exemptions to govt and private actors in unclear circumstances, imposes penalties on data principals, and so on. further, the public consultation process for the current version is flawed, as it was tabled and passed in the parliament without specific consultations and though its previous version was open for feedback from the public, the suggestions were not publicly displayed, neither were they incorporated, at least not in a transparent manner. iff has done a deeper analysis on the act, which can be [accessed here]( ### voter card linking with aadhaar on february 09, several lok sabha members asked the ministry of law and justice about the number of voter ids linked with aadhaar since the election laws (amendment) act, 2021 and how consent is being obtained for the same. they also inquired about how a voter’s aadhaar details will be deleted upon withdrawal of consent and if the names of voters not linked with aadhaar will be removed from voter lists. further, they asked about the measures put in place to safeguard the voter database from misuse. minister of state replied saying that the election commission of india (“eci”) has previously clarified that the representation of the people act, 1950, as amended by the election laws act, 2021, permits electoral registration officers to request aadhaar numbers from electors voluntarily for identity verification. he added that starting august 01, 2022, a voluntary aadhaar collection program has been initiated nationwide but linking of aadhaar with election photo identity cards has not commenced yet. for now, submitting aadhaar with voter id is optional, with consent obtained via form 6b. currently there are no provisions for deleting aadhaar details if consent is withdrawn. the eci oversees electoral roll preparation and ensures data security through multi-layered encryption. ### one nation, one student id on february 05, parliamentarians asked the education ministry for clarity on the “one nation, one student id” initiative, including the objectives of the initiative, measures to ensure student data confidentiality, and guidelines to prevent data breaches. minister of state for education replied that under the framework, a ‘registry framework’ tracks students’ academic journeys, facilitates credit transfers, and aligns programs with skill components. stringent data security measures under meity’s guidelines will ensure confidentiality and prevent data breaches. iff has previously flagged the framework for the privacy concerns it raises, which persist despite the minister’s assurances. read our analysis [here]( there were other discussions that we tracked live, including on [data collection through aarogya setu]( linking of [aadhaar with health schemes]( [leaks of aadhaar data]( in recent times, blocking of content on social media sites ([here]( here), [regulation of pirated content]( status and mechanisms under the [broadcasting services (regulation) bill, 2023]( cybercrimes and fraud ([here]( [here]( building capacity and [upskilling for digital public infrastructure]( roll-out, and the impact of [ai on the labour market]( ## conclusion the budget session gave us one notable high, which is a marked increase in ministerial budgets, but other than that sustained trends from last year – high projected estimates but underutilisation of funds. in light of the increasing digitisation across sectors and the increasing demand for improved digital literacy as well as access to digital services, we hope that the fund allocation in these concerned sectors continue to witness a positive trend. in terms of productivity, though both houses sat for an extra day, the discussions focused on political agenda items since this would be the last parliamentary sitting for the 17th lok sabha, and the last for the incumbent government before we break for elections in april-may 2024. some pertinent questions were asked by opposition members which touched upon digital rights and freedoms, but we noted that the responses were not adequate, and data privacy concerns for many issues remain unaddressed. we remain optimistic that the upcoming union government will give these issues their deserved attention and careful consideration. *this post has been drafted with assistance from vinamra harkar, policy intern, internet freedom

1cfxaqb,"biggest pity for me is how stray dog control isn't part of the election manifesto. if it were, i'd happily vote for a party which is proactive in dealing with it. why? well we cant live in a city where a child walking in the street isn't safe. i would love to take care of street dogs if our governments had the money to do so.. in fact i'd rather our government spend less on maintaining city roads and instead use all that money to construct a massive dog farm to help street dogs. but in no possible way would i want stray dogs to be released in the streets and treated as ""street"" dogs. you either raise the funds to go all the way to treating them humanely by contructing dog parks or humanely euthanize them when their population is too big. but in no world can we permit an innocent 1 year old child being mauled to death and yet having no measure of recourse to prevent these from happening again. i like what bjp has done for infrastructure but i'd happily switch to any party whatsoever who can take a more practical, immediate and proactive stand to take care of stray dogs. again, i am not saying cruelly culling them as the only solution. but releasing dogs to the streets is definitely not a solution. you either tax, reprioritize infra funds and create massive dog parks to maintain them or humanely euthanize them if their population becomes too high. it breaks my heart on the euthanization idea but how can weigh it against an innocent child being violently mauled to death. at least read the manifestos if you are going to complain about it. from congress' manifesto: >the menace of stray dogs has acquired alarming proportions. solutions will be found that will protect humans (especially children) and that are consistent with a humanitarian approach to animals. source: i commend you, op for choosing to vote based on an actual practical issue rather than vague concepts. you are right. missed this in congress manifesto. have to say this single thing flips my vote for me. menaka gandhi with her pseudo idealistic stand has made the streets unsafe for children unfortunately. while her humane policy is understandable we don't have the budget to support it. absolutely what the fk has bjp done for infrastructure? with all the cow nonsense they still couldn't do jackshit for cows and you're expecting them to handle dogs? ever tried calling the cow helpline to report injured cattle? you'll know once you try, there have been times where i was denied service cuz it was a bull, thats how crazy these folks are, gender discrimination for bovine. wtf. i love dogs more than children, but no child should die because of a dog attack. animals have to be handled at a community level, i've seen stray dogs be aggressive towards rag picker children cuz they also are (sadly) dumpster divers, it's like competing for resources hence dogs are aggressive.","User prioritizes stray dog control, criticizing lack of plans.

1c2wkka,"why you must read the congress manifesto. apart from the paanch nyay which outlines the promises of the manifesto and embodies the spirit of its electoral plank, congress' manifesto makes bold and crucial promises which makes it one of the most progressive document in the nation's history. after years of corporate and communal agenda of the modi government, congress' pro-people plank is a breath of fresh air for a nation reeling under crises of unemployment, inequality, and injustice. congress' manifesto also sets a progressive agenda for the election, and stands in contrast to the muslim league and veg/non-veg agenda of modi. the manifesto is divided into 10 sections on equity, youth, women, workers, farmers, defending the constitution, economy, federalism, national security, and environment. some key points from the manifesto: 1. reform in collegium system, establishing a court of appeals, promoting diversity in judiciary. 2. recognising civil unions for same-sex marriage. 3. protection of civil liberties and freedom of dress, food, and language. 4. reform in personal laws. 5. gender equality, equal work, equal pay, hostel for working women. 6. decriminalising civil defamation. 7. right to privacy. 8. strengthening parliamentary system. 9. end to weaponization of law, police raj, custodial deaths. 10. right to health. 11. addressing the growing inequality. 12. multi-modal urban public transport. 13. environment protection and climate change authority, green new deal investment programme 14. apprenticeship scheme modelled on germany's dual education system to promote skill and employment, reform in gig economy, district level start-up fund. 16. urban employment guarantee act, right to health and social security for the workers, end to the casualization of labour. also read, [jobs in the congress manifesto: a promise and a hope : prof santosh mehrotra]( [congress releases its manifesto : ravish kumar]( [congress' pro-people agenda promises a new deal for the youth, women, workers, farmers, and the backward classes]( [गंभीर जवाब की मांग करता है कांग्रेस का न्यायपत्र : योगेंद्र यादव]( [harsh mander: congress manifesto is not perfect – but kindles some hope]( the biggest point that matters to me, is the banning of horsetrading. those are a lot of vague statements as opposed to anything tangible. many of them sound like the kind of answers miss world contestants give: nobody can disagree with most of them and many are indeed good things to have - but there doesn't seem to be any substantial idea of how to get there. > reform in collegium system, establishing a court of appeals, promoting diversity in judiciary. good idea, but the courts have opposed this and will continue to do so.

[in the past they have been confused over the issue]( again: will an *inc-led coalition govt* have the political will to push this through? > strengthening parliamentary system. what exactly does that mean? will the anti defection law be repealed? this is the single biggest structural contributor towards the decimation of the parliamentary system. when your mp/mla is legally required to vote as per the diktats of the party, they effectively become puppets of the leadership. parliament/assemblies are reduced to irrelevance because you could literally replace them with an excel sheet that multiplies the number of mps/mlas each party has with the vote that the party boss wants them to cast. there is no scope for the mp/mla to vote in the best interests of her constituency. this in turn creates this quasi-presidential type of election, because it is ultimately the party boss who calls all the shots. i doubt the inc will repeal it, because this also weakens the leadership (while empowering the rank and file) of their own party and allies. this is also why the bjp will also not repeal it. > multi-modal urban public transport. excellent idea, but pushing this from the centre is a deeply flawed approach. even pushing it down from the state govt level is problematic; the right solution has to be to empower civic bodies by decentralising power, giving them revenue generation capabilities and making them accountable to citizens of the city. this enables each city to produce a system that works for its unique needs - the constraints and needs of mumbai are very different from those of bangalore. again, nobody wants to do this kind of decentralisation because it reduces the power of the centre and state govts - and the inc manifesto suggests they too want to go in the opposite direction. 1) collegium system reform and the njac committee needs to have a majority of judges themselves, else they will strike it down like how sc struck down bjp’s bill see karan thapar’s interview with congress manifesto committee member praveen chakravarty 2. progressive 3. good upholding civil liberties and fundamental constitutional principles/rights 4. dont make a blanket statement be more specific. 5. be more specific, you mean for govt employees? 6. good 7. good 8. good they promised 100 days of sitting atleast and one day per week on opposition’s agenda guess what!!!! karan thapar in the interview asked why dint they bring in a promise that they would have the exclusive pm question hour in the parliament like the uk house of commons have?? 9. i dont buy into this. 10. universal healthcare of upto 25l , where is the money going to come from??? 11. they dont talk about inheritance tax , but promise direct cash transfers to the poor. 12. no solid plan of action. bjp too promised this and is working on it in the north. 13. good but they dont talk about how much % increase in forest cover would happen but still good 14. good on apprenticeship. but district level start up fund - eye wash. if 5000 crores is divided to each district then it will be like around 2-5 crores for each district which is way too less for the population we have. telling this from personal experience of trying to raise funds from gok elevate karnataka scheme , starting up myself in ai in stock market for automation portfolio management with my iiit friends. its so hard to get talent recognised and funding from govt. they will end up funding like 2-5 lakh or 10lakh to each startup which is of no major use if you want to get into r&d and innovation from what i can hear from raga/congress speeches is that this is rather a fund to help poor people to set up their own shop or supermarket or msme like that 15. i have no idea >strengthening parliamentary system. as long as anti defection law exists, mps won't have much power in legislations since they have to dance to the tunes of high command their manifesto is rubbish and involves just throwing money at people to get their votes. their manifesto for defense is extremely poor and the fact they plan to scrap agniveer just shows that they don't care about the progress made in the armed forces. nobody is falling for their desperate and pathetic attempt at trying to beat the bjp the fact they plan to increase the reservation cap should be reason enough to not give a vote to this dying party","This detailed analysis praises the Congress party's 2024 election manifesto as progressive and comprehensive. Some users highlight specific promises: judiciary reforms including a Court of Appeals, recognition of same-sex civil unions, protection of civil liberties, gender equality measures, right to health, urban employment guarantees, and environmental protections. The emotional tone is generally positive with hopeful anticipation, though some commenters express skepticism about implementation feasibility. Several users engage in substantive policy discussion, questioning how certain reforms would navigate political and legal obstacles, particularly regarding personal law changes, anti-defection laws, and LGBTQ+ rights. There's debate about the manifesto's substance versus vague promises, with some criticizing what they perceive as unrealistic commitments. The conversation reflects broader political divisions, with supporters viewing the document as a refreshing alternative to BJP's agenda, while detractors question its practicality and funding mechanisms.","['congress manifesto makes bold and crucial promises', 'recognising civil unions for same-sex marriage', 'protection of civil liberties and freedom', 'right to health', 'urban employment guarantee act']",Political Parties
1crmgct,"what’s it gonna take for us as a society to finally care about air quality and climate change on a mass scale? as an indian residing overseas, i visit india about twice a year and every time after i land, i get either a nasal infection, itchiness or face allergies which are not gone until i go back to my country of residence. doctors often point out that it is the reaction to the extreme air pollution. i know many people who face similar issues. living in an indian metropolis is equivalent to smoking multiple cigarettes daily. — i’m deeply concerned about the lack of widespread action and the unmuted response to the environmental emergencies. - we owe it to our parents who deserve to breathe fresh air in their golden years, to fellow citizens l, and future generations. they should inherit the nation that’s as beautiful and bountiful as its meant to be. - it goes beyond health. imagine getting unobscured view of the himalayas and our country being lauded for the beauty and cleanliness and us becoming a leader in promoting a cleaner and pristine natural environment, globally. - in my country of residence , germany, parties are solely formed on the basis of environmental issues. ( green party for example) and elections can make or break on the basis of environmental issues. - this also has to do with what we as a society demand from our law and policy makers. here i observe a huge pressure from the general population to breathe fresh air, get clean water and access to a ton of natural beauty to make living more fulfilling. - we are still way focussed on topics such as communal and religious politics, in an unhealthy proposition. - i am sure many people who have been in other parts of the world also more or less notice it. but it still hasn’t become a mainstream issue. none of the election manifestos emphasise on those topics. i wonder what is it going to take to finally that to happen! edit: a lot of people are straight up jumping to developed cvs developing country comparison. my question is, is physics and ecology going to care and wait until your, mine and our loved ones’ bodies have permanent damages? are the ice glaciers going to wait for the next 50 years until india is developed and the wrongdoing in the past by other countries are balanced before cities like mumbai are submerged? and other extreme weather conditions? also why cannot we make our living conditions better if we see an obvious problem instead of jumping into ‘what-aboutism’ ? most people in our country are poor and uneducated. neither are they aware about environmental issues and their impacts, nor do they care about the benefit of the entire society. these selfish groups just care about getting out of this cycle of poverty and getting mini ego-boosts by crushing their ""enemies"" politically. keep in mind that most of these folks do not have a lot of joy in life, nor much of self-respect. they make do by feeling superior to a particular religion or some castes, because without that - what do they have? politicians obviously take advantage of these fools to get their votes. none of the political parties in india can survive by taking up issues that are of concern to the educated and the environmentally sensitive. so welcome to indian politics where it's all about hindu vs muslim. fucking jokers! there are a lot of people in india who have a vested interest in polluting. think about all the farmers burning stubble, the firework manufacturers and the criminal developers cutting illegal plots and sending the sewage line right into water bodies. an aqi of 300 in bejing was enough to trigger an emergency response, here in the north of india we literally have the top 50 most polluted cities globally and fuk all is done. when focus is religion, shit will continue to propagate, in our gated society people are pooling resources to make a temple and not invest in solar panels for energy needs for everyone's benefit. our country foremost is poor. the countries you gave example are developed countries which have an educated and well to do population. when you have problem to get your next meal, climate change is definitely a minor issue for you when the average of our society no longer needs to focus their entire physical and mental energy to provide food and shelter for themselves and their families.","This discussion addresses India's severe environmental pollution problems and their absence from political agendas. Some users, including an overseas Indian, share personal experiences of health issues caused by air pollution during visits. Several commenters express frustration that election discourse focuses on communal issues rather than existential threats like air, water, and food contamination. The emotional tone combines concern, anger, and helplessness, with users criticizing governmental inaction despite international alerts about contaminated products. Some argue that poverty and lack of education prevent environmental concerns from gaining political traction, while others reject this as 'whataboutism.' The conversation reveals deep anxiety about long-term health impacts and systemic failure to prioritize environmental governance. Users note that neither major party's manifesto adequately addresses pollution, reflecting broader societal neglect of ecological issues despite their immediate public health consequences.","['the alarming state of air, water, food pollution', 'every time after i land, i get either a nasal infection', 'election issues never move from religion and caste', 'our food is poisoned, our air is poisoned', 'nobody in this country gives a s**t about that']",Social Issues
1c63beh,"whose manifesto do you like better? i have created a word doc that has topic wise side by side comparison. all the points are as they appear in the manifestos. (i haven't changed anything) **here is the document :** [**manifesto topic wise comparison**]( **about the document** *read time of the entire document : 15 minutes* *the document has exact words from both the manifestos without change, and i have included all the points in both the manifestos and classified it topic wise manually. no chatgpt or any other ai tools used so that they don't miss any points and hallucinate etc etc.* *some points can belong to multiple topics, i have added most points only once in the document.* *if you think some points can be better classified into other sections, please suggest/comment in the document or here.* *it would be great if any of you can convert this into an interactive website (like streamlit using python) for greater accessibility and good.* *please form your opinions only after going through the entire document/manifestos, there are a lot of things proposed by both sides that are astonishing and are less talked about in the social media/media space* **general first thoughts about both the manifestos:** 1. the first thing that caught my attention was that, congress' manifesto has neutral english language and neutral section pictures. bjps manifesto is so much filled with hindi words in english that is so hard to comprehend and you know has name and pictures of modi everywhere. 2. congress' manifesto is overall well balanced and less vague than bjp and gives my heart a positive hope about our shared future. finally it feels like all the things we rant about on reddit regarding democracy and centralization of power has been addressed. however their manifesto on travel infrastructure (like ports/airports/roads) is short and general. bjps manifesto is filled majorly only related to infrastructure points that are vague.. in most points they talk about what they have done in the past and how they will continue the same. 3. congress emphasises a lot on the personal human aspect of governance like freedoms and liberties. **freebies or welfare** whatever you call it **:** 1. **the myth that congress is a freebie government and something that would bankrupt us is overblown**. 2. **what if i told you bjp also doles out equal freebies if not more?** i was shocked to know that bjp in last 10 years has given out 34 lakh crore alone in direct cash transfers to beneficiaries. they have mentioned this in the initial pages if you want to verify. 3. what congress is probably going to do is unbundle various schemes through which the present govt does cash transfers and then re-bundle them into one scheme ""mahalakshmi"" and give out 1 lakh per poor women family. 4. congress is most likely to do this transfers only after socio-economic survey and my guess is that it would atleast take a year or two along with census. they would try to limit the outflow as much as possible. 5. lastly since the amount is fixed at 1l a year , as economy grows this outflow will remain same while collections increase. **democracy, constitutional bodies and judiciary:** 1. **this section is what gives me a positive hope.** 2. **division of supreme court into 1. constitutional court 2. court of appeal** 1. i think this is to avoid judges to sit on cases of constitutional validity/importance for years like the electoral bonds case since 2019 and the money bill to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny 3. congress in depth talks about decentralization of power after their experience of having brutally suffered in the last 10 years and the abuse of power. they now know what to fix to strengthen this democracy. 1. **from centre to states** : 1. they said they would transfer some subjects from concurrent list to state list. basically making the centre focus more on things like defense (national security), foreign affairs and give more autonomy to states and better tax sharing between centre/states 2. **remember delhi govt and constant interference from lg (lt. governor)?** : here is what they say 1. we will amend the government of national capital territory of delhi act, 1991 and declare that the lieutenant governor shall act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers of nct, delhi on all matters, including services, except on matters concerning the three reserved subjects. 3. **more powers to local city and rural bodies (:** 1. taking into account rapid urbanisation, they say that they will amend the laws to grant more executive, financial and administrative powers to the directly-elected mayor/chairperson for effective governance in urban local bodies and gram sabhas/panchayats *( a. the panchayats (extension to scheduled areas) act, 1996. (b.) the forest rights act, 2006. (c.) the land acquisition act, 2013).* i think this has to do something with taking over of villagers/tribal land for commercial exploitation and deforestation.. 2. improved governance of mayors to improve urban governance, the mayor/chairperson will be directly elected for a fixed term of 5 years along with a council. executive, financial and administrative powers will be conferred upon the mayor/chairperson. the administration will be accountable to the mayor/chairperson and the council. 3. i think this has something to do with local cities not holding mayoral elections regularly like bmc/bbmp 4. a portion of gst revenues will be allocated to panchayats and municipalities 4. **more powers to sport bodies :** they also talk about decentralization of power to sport bodies acc to recommendations of the justice lodha committee and olympic charter etc to prevent and solve the whole mess around wrestlers. 5. **institutionalize the process of appointing the chief of defence staff to ensure transparency and military consensus** 6. **prevention of horse trading , automatic disqualification:** to amend the tenth schedule of the constitution and make defection an auto disqualification of the membership in the assembly or parliament. 7. **law to tally 100% of evm with vvpat** 8. **we promise to strengthen the autonomy of the election commission of india (vague)** 9. **no to one nation one election (a big big thing for democracy)** 10. **to improve transparency in media and give more freedoms to journalists** 1. **repeal broadcasting services (regulation) bill, 2023** 2. review and delete controversial clauses that give unbridled powers of censorship to the government from digital personal data protection act, 2023; press and registration of periodicals act, 2023, etc.) 3. amend the press council of india act, 1978 to strengthen the system of self regulation, protect journalistic freedoms, uphold editorial independence and guard against government interference against arbitrary search and seizures... 11. **pledge to ensure that both houses of parliament will convene for 100 days each year, reviving and upholding the esteemed traditions of parliament.** 12. **additionally, one day per week will be dedicated to discussing the agenda proposed by opposition benches in each house.** 13. **we promise to end the arbitrary and indiscriminate suspension of the internet** 14. **review the telecommunications act, 2023 and remove the provisions that restrict freedom of speech and expression and that violate the right to privacy.** we promise to review all laws that interfere with the right to privacy and make suitable amendments to various laws to uphold the right to privacy 15.we promise to enact a law on bail that will incorporate the principle that ‘bail is the rule, jail is the exception’ in all criminal laws. 16. **review of all laws passed without discussion and scrutiny by nda** 1. all anti-people laws passed by the bjp/nda without proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate, especially those relating to workers, farmers, criminal justice, environment & forests and digital data protection, will be thoroughly reviewed and changed. rest of the things i will talk in future posts.. whats your take and thoughts??? obviously congress's manifesto is better. like far better than bjp's. in the current situation of our country like unemployment, inflation, manipur and ladakh issue,etc. congress has a lot to offer, while bjp is talking about conducting olympics in 2036. although there are some flaws in congress manifesto, i see a clear, vision focused manifesto from congress. otoh, bjp's manifesto is nothing to write home about except couple of developmental projects. congress learned from their mistakes and it is reflected in manifesto. but bjp manifesto reeks of over-confidence and arrogance imo. the reservation cap uplifting and minority benefits based on religion is a big no but other than that their manifesto is the best one out there i would prefer if they could bring a uniform civil code like france, so that the damage done but religious sentiments can be repaired i would also recommend them to officially recognise atheism or no religion. bjp manifesto is vague. it is mostly one liner like a student writes exam. congress manifesto is a little detailed. but bjp has good schemes such as expansion of roads (nhai), new trains and renewable energy. as evs and population grows, energy is going to be a necessity. the problem with bjp manifesto is that it is mostly continuation of existing schemes and expansion, rather than new good schemes. congress has lgbtq which is quite progressive, and reservation cap is a huge no no. congress has a few more good policies such as making up to xii classes mandatory, and right to apprenticeship. mnrega and asha worker salary increment is also good. making water harvesting mandatory was also good esp as we have started facing shortages in cities. reservations is a huge huge no in case of congress. all i want is bjp to win, but with no absolute or brute majority or with majority that can be bought. i want democracy to function well and bills to be discussed rather than bypassed. that is all my expectation is from this election. congress.","This post provides a detailed comparative analysis of BJP and Congress election manifestos, based on the user's own document creation.

1bzosfy,"reasons not to vote for congress (as per their manifesto ) 1. the congress guarantees that it will pass a constitutional amendment to raise the 50 per cent cap on reservations for sc, st and obc (pg - 6) \[they have completely ignored merit\] 2. congress will abolish the contractualization of regular jobs in the government and public sector enterprises and ensure regularisation of such appointments (pg - 6) \[this contractualization of govt jobs for eg lets say teaching aim at improving the teaching quality but then again inc wants to abolish this and go back to teachers who would even get away with not attending the college\] 3. we will enact a law with reference to article 15(5) of the constitution to provide for reservation in private educational institutions for sc, st and obc (pg -6) \[private colleges tend to have high fees, on whom would the burden lie? the govt?\] 4. we promise that healthcare will be universal and free in public health centres such as hospitals, clinics, primary health centres, mobile healthcare units, dispensaries and health camps. free healthcare will include examination, diagnostics, treatment, surgery, medicines, rehabilitation and palliative care (pg-9) \[this cannot be possible in a country like india, all of that burden would be placed on the middle class\] 5. government will give a one-time relief to applicants who were unable to write the qualifying public examinations during 1 april 2020 to 30 june 2021 due to the pandemic (pg-11) \[freebies\] 6. we will ensure that all higher educational institutions — central, state and private — meet the prescribed standards for admitting students. we will revisit the policy of centrally-conducted qualifying examinations such as neet, cuet, etc. and make it optional for state governments to adopt these examinations for admissions or conduct their own examinations meeting the prescribed standards to state-funded and state-approved higher educational institutions (pg-13) \[this would again reduce chances for talented individuals to be admitted in top colleges, for eg its very hard for students in bihar board to score 99% as compared to students of kerala board\] 7. we will reserve one-half (50 per cent) of central government jobs for women starting in 2025 (pg-16) 8. we reject the ‘one nation one election’ idea and we promise that elections to the lok sabha and the state assemblies will be held as and when they are due in accordance with the constitution and the traditions of a parliamentary democracy (pg - 22) \[one nation one election would save lots of cost for govt\] 9. we promise to enact a law on bail that will incorporate the principle that ‘bail is the rule, jail is the exception’ in all criminal laws. (pg-22) didnt put in effort to read pg 28 onwards, these were enough reasons for me not to vote for congress. only thing i found commendable was their protest against the telecommunication bill. tldr; congress does not promote merit rather casteism i want to live in harmony and not be afraid of riot happening in my city/state just because of some stupid religious shit. gujarat governed by bj pee for 29 years and still not the number one in healthcare, education is pathetic. is it free of corruption? nope. i would rather vote for congress. i hate it but its miles ahead of bj pee. 10 years of bj party is more than enough. people get screwed regardless, at least if it's congress, we'll have our fundamental rights intact, have a critical public, opposition and a parliamentary democracy. besides their manifesto is very progressive and commendable if they achieve it. anyone is better than bjp. idc who comes in the center, i don't want bjp. they've done enough damage in the last 10 years. it is your vote. your prerogative item 6 deserves a discussion. national entrance exam was introduced to give parity to all different board students. current scheme of admission via entrance exam only helps coaching institutions. if the net result is more state funded institutions and seats that is a good decision item 4 is another interesting area. with increased automation there will be no jobs for everyone. nation must take care of all its people, healthcare in one such area state fundings needs to go up . many states with less corruption have better standards than states where corruption is historically high. (bjp has similar goals but it focuses on insurance) i would take all the talk of reservation from congress seriously, if it implemented jiski jitni abadi utana uska haq, within their party high command. after all as gandhiji once said “be the change you wish to see in the world”.","This post criticizes the Congress party's election manifesto across multiple policy areas.

1cbuxc6,"political strategy of bjp and why they are going off-limits during karnataka elections there was a huge anti-incumbency factor. the congress did a great job by raising questions like poverty, employement and kept it grounded. whereas bjp's main focus was hindutva. in addition to this, the congress party highlighted their shortcomings. even after the backing of media among other things, congress was able to win. what bjp is trying to do now is to go off-limits. bjp's strategy is to 1) defame the congress manifesto 2) invoke hindu-muslim 3) paint congress as anti-hindu is it going to work? 1) the hindu-muslim narrative will backfire a little since most people saw modi as good guy. now his mask is off. there are things to say. people who don't care much about hindu-muslim is not gonna vote for him now. a percentage of swing voters mainly. as for people who care about hindu-muslim, they were already in team bjp. 2) defame the congress - that's where bjp is hitting their mark rural people are the main victims. they are trying their best to defame congress and their manifesto through the mangalsutra narrative and wealth redistribution narrative. nowhere in their manifesto ""wealth redistribution"" is even mentioned. lmao . in fact, in the interview with rahul, wealth redistribution word was never mentioned by him. they did mention reducing income disparity etc. 3) paint congress as anti-hindu - softcore hindutva people are going to be influenced by these narrative if the congress is able to clear its image and the image of the manifesto, they will be able to have good chances. people are angry with bjp. 1) kshatriyas, jatts, muslims are not going to vote for bjp amid tensions 2) farmers are very unlikely to vote for bjp 3) they've already decreased their focus to only hsrd-followes of hindus 4) anti-incumbency is a big factor. nobody except nehru has been able to come to power for 15 years. 5) exam leaks, unemployment. a big percentage of people are angry with bjp 6) they've given much evidence that india is headed towards dictatorship after the first phase, modi's strategy has changed. he has become a little desperate and bjp as a whole became very hostile. if congress can make it through there's a high chance they might win. indians have herd mentality. the shifting of momentum can be sudden and dramatic. we can not count the chickens yet but there is definitely some ripple in the water judging by the strategy adopted by bjp after 1st phase. if someone doesn't control bjp,they will come after us *openly*-the average citizens! kuch nai ho na hai bhai . har election main log excite hote hai. people seem to forget we believe in religion so much we dont care about logic and humanity... religion aka hatred always wins in this country... lets get on with this election drama phase.. and then get back to our normal lives..","This analysis examines BJP's political strategy during Karnataka elections and its potential national implications.

1976t24,"why do indians not possess basic civic sense, specially when it comes to our own country i love india, it is always going to be home. i love how people are more or less always willing to help you when you are in a sticky situation, i know this is not everyone's experience but, so far i feel india is it's people. i love our incredibly rich and ancient history, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, home to the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, home to mighty warriors and empires, home to great heroes and yet preaching humility in it's ethos, it's incredible, i can go on and on. but, in this post i want to talk about us indians and what is going so wrong with us. i don't want to delve into politics, religion or caste, it's overdone and it always makes the conversation negative, maybe one day we evolve to have an open discussion about that too but, today i want to talk about other things. cleanliness - we don't need to be educated to understand that literring is bad. i mean why do we just love throwing garbage everywhere, i have seen plastic garbage on the beaches of goa, mangroves of kerala and even the mountain treks of himachal. it's so pathetic, this has to purely be on us indians right, it's so logical, hold on to your garbage till you find a bin. female safety - we have a pathetic rep for this, pathetic doesn't even describe a fraction of it. you can reach specific subs on reddit where women are narrating their most horrible experiences. my question is can we genuinely not do anything? i mean it's so bad, a country where the majority prays to goddesses and then the most heinous of crimes happen. again i don't think this is government's fault or comes with uneducation not following rules - yes it's tardy, we are a populous country so there are queues everywhere but, they are there for a reason. what is this flex of not wearing helmets, not stopping at red lights, breaking queues, actively offering bribes for smallest inconveniences and on and on ultra defensive - recently some african accounts on twitter posted about how indian street food is very unhygienic and they did this through a very popular form of communication, posting funny memes. well it is a fact, our street food vendors, specially some content available online shows very nicely how they dip their hands, sweat and sometimes entire bodies in the food they make. many nationalists jumped on this and started racially abusing africans. why does it have to be like that, man our street food is unhygienic, period. why so defensive that we call everything either chinese or pakistani propaganda pakistan - man it's a failed state, move on. i hate that we even talk about that crap country and compare with ours, standards bro rich privilege - this is true in every part of the world. you are rich, you throw money at your problems and the problem vanishes. only the problem here is the poverty is such high contrast that it makes the privilege look even more arrogant. it's just sad that income inequality is so exacerbated and most of the rich here are actually taking a crap on the poor infrastructure - it just sucks that our city infrastructure is not comparable to some of the best in the world. even poorer cities have better public infrastructure than india's mumbai and delhi and it's not good. now this point can be borderline politics, so i'll stop here healthcare - though we have some of the cheapest healthcare available, oh man the condition of hospitals is so bad it will make your eyes tear up, just go to a government hospital once and you will never ever wish anyone you know to get admitted in government hospitals. one sport country - cricket is great! if the brits didn't invent it, i am sure some kids in shivaji park in bombay would have. the only things we love more than cricket are our parents, emotional baggage, defensive mechanisms and insecurities. but hell a 10 country world cup with only 8 test playing nations is just laughable. there are so many atheletes out there who would die for our love and support and are waiting for just one chance to make us proud. we pin our hopes on them at a global event like the olympics and then forget about them for 4 years. specifically guys who support football clubs based in europe but, won't go to see indian football team play, screw all of you, you deserve a special place in the nethers of hell i can go on but, i'll stop now. maybe you guys can add more or counteract. i love india and i hope there does come a time when we as a people realize what a beautiful country we are blessed with and start taking care of it more most of the indians do not care about the rules and think it is cool to break them. one of my friends broke a traffic rule. when i confronted him, he said ""rules sirf chutiyon ke liye hain"". the fact that you had to write a prologue on your love for india before you could come to the point, says a lot about our current situation. when you don't trust a system and don't get anything concretely favorable from it, then you stop caring about upholding what the system stands for. whoever it is ruling the country, the perception is that they do it for power, wealth, and greed. whatever welfare provided to the people is a mere ""sprinkle"" in comparison to what they are actually capable of. and this is at every level in the bureaucracy. i'm not saying everyone is corrupt, but it is not uncommon. people working as laborers, construction workers, and other hourly wage jobs believe they are stuck in an endless loop of turmoil. when will they ever break out of this? will a gas cylinder or pressure cooker before elections fix their overall well-being? they definitely don't think so, and logically, so wouldn't we. why should they even abide by the rules? it's a chicken and egg problem. the more you look into the past with lost glory, the more divided we will get. most of us are not ready to accept that we need improvement and not everything can be blamed on the gora and invaders. yeah you were dealt a bad set of cards for the past 600 years or so but instead we have made it our culture. frankly speaking, we are still tribal ( more men=more resources=more power=more women=more my customs=my history only). hence we vote our caste and not cast our vote. the root cause of problems such as literring of road, scribbling on monuments, unhygienic conditions are the following mindset ""apan ko kya lena dena"", ""koi farak nhi padta"", ""koi nhi dekh rha"" we can't blame the goverment or the education system when we have grown up watching examples of these types of mindset, we need to work on educating and setting up better civic sense for the kids, future generation needs to learn it from the early childhood for example we were taught the importance of water very thoroughly in schools and i think everyone remembers the leaking tap and a bucket of water photo","In a lengthy critique prefaced by declarations of love for India, a user lists failures of Indian civic sense: rampant littering in natural areas, terrible women's safety records, a culture of breaking rules (traffic laws, queues, bribes), extreme defensiveness against criticism (exemplified by racist backlash to Africans commenting on street food hygiene), obsession with Pakistan, stark income inequality, poor urban infrastructure, substandard public healthcare, and an over-focus on cricket.

It ends with a resigned 'now bear it all together.'

[ it's no wonder women are not safe in this country. i would be happy if she joins congress instead but if she joins bjp, it just shows her true colors. an ""activist"" whose morals can easily be bought. while everyone here seems to be busy in talking about the allegations and the video recording that came out, good but not sufficient here is what most people arent talking about and some more questions that people need to ask aap : 1. ⁠the allegations are not on kejriwal himself, but his pa..so why does he dodge the question when asked yesterday in press conference? 2. ⁠if he believes that swati maliwal’s allegations are true even to a remote extent, he can simply say, we are suspending the pa until outcome of investigation and allowing the police to investigate. 3. ⁠if he believes that they are fabricated and a conspiracy by bjp to tarnish aap, then why isn’t aap coming forward and releasing the cctv footage themselves to clear the air? wont that actually prove they are not the same as bjp. will actually prove they stand for transparency and women’s safety rather than just talk about these issues only when accused is from their political rivals. rest everything is just trying to spin a narrative both from supporters of aap/india alliance and supporters of bjp • ⁠its been noticed that she isnt active after she took oath as rs member and she hasnt actively participated in protests staged against the arrest of kejriwal, she isnt seen anywhere, neither in pcs or otherwise • ⁠she being dcw chief , knows the rules and protocols to follow when such incidents occur, the allegations in the fir are damning, wonder why she visited the police station on the first day but returned without filing a complaint, because there is no way such allegations can be compromised upon between aap , accused and the victim. • ⁠for 2-3 days she does not give any statement/makes no appearance, then goes for a medical checkup. so these are some points people are talking to say she has staged it, maybe maybe not who knows but notice how none of them actually pertain to the “alleged assault”. maybe she has had a fallout with aap after being nominated as rs member, but that doesn’t mean she can be abused. she not giving a police complaint on the first day has nothing to do with the actual “assault” that may or may not have happened. an assault might have actually happened and she visited police station but had pressure on her to withdraw her case or whatever she going to aiims after a delay, the delay has nothing to do with the actual alleged assault. all these are logical fallacies, none of these affect or prove or disprove the actual alleged assault. both sides seem fishy, but the benefit of the doubt should be given to the victims in such cases and the case has to be investigated thoroughly. supporters of aap just cant do usual whataboutery the way bjp does by saying “why dint she file a case on first day, why dint she go to aiims on the first day?, and making allegations that bjp has a hand behind this etc etc” , makes aap look so cheap in politics allegations themselves are portrayed and assumed as truth by their opponents. just naming arvind kejriwal in liquor case as accused was enough for bjp to declare aap and him as corrupt and guilty. and at that time when allegations were on aap, aap did press conferences everyday showing how bjp got electoral bonds from the south liquor lobby and showing other evidence etc aap should do the same here with full transparency and integrity. when it comes to politics, accusations have to be defended tooth and nail as well, not just left to be proven by the person making allegations because they will definitely be milked for political mileage. swati maliwal in her recent tweet stated that let cctv footage come out, truth will be out. so aap should release and make it transparent and clear all the air and fishiness. their silence is awful. aap cannot stay silent while elections are going to happen next week, we all know how godi media and bjp machinery will milk this issue till the election where perception matters. else it is the same as bjp, and just throwing mud at each other","This lengthy thread details the swirling allegations and counter-allegations between AAP and its former Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal.

Atishi presents a video showing Maliwal at the CM's residence, arguing it contradicts her FIR claims of a brutal assault. AAP's narrative is that Maliwal arrived unannounced, created a scene, and threatened staff. Maliwal responds on social media, accusing Kejriwal of being a 'political hitman' using edited videos, and demands release of full CCTV footage. Commenters are deeply divided. Some find AAP's story suspicious given the video and Maliwal's delayed medical exam; others question why AAP doesn't release all CCTV footage if exonerating. There's discussion of Maliwal's recent low profile in the party and comparisons to other high-profile departures.

1e2s46z,"what is lesser evilism and how to defeat it lesser evilism(le) is typically used to refer to advocating supporting a less despicable party to prevent an worse, often far-right party from getting power. # why is it bad? lesser evilism leads to maintaining capitalist status quo while giving lip service to democracy. a common argument given by lesser-evilists(les) is that the outcome of an election would be even worse if people do not vote for the lesser evil. this by itself is true, but the problem lies in not recognizing that voting should only be a temporary bulwark against fascism and that it should not be the place where politics begins and ends. it is completely understandable is say a person fully advocates and radicalizes people for anti-capitalism for four years and spends 20 minutes on election day to vote for the lesser evil *(and i don't regard this category to be le for the purpose of this post).* **but les don't.** they spend all of their time defending the lesser evil capitalist party throughout and continue to support it before, during and after elections, completely ignoring the needs to working classes(local and global) and contributing to maintaining capitalism. *where is the ""evil"" in their ""lesser-evilism""?* they might as well believe that their favorite parties are not ""lesser-evil"", but are genuinely good and the end result would the same - deceiving the working classes. # understanding lesser evilism the fact is many les don't really believe that their parties are the lesser evil in the dictionary definition of evil. how do you know? it is simple. every time an le claims that biden is the lesser evil, tell them lesser evil is.. still evil and that still makes biden an evil man(use this exact wording). i have seen many supposed les get weirdly uncomfortable with this obvious inference and experience cognitive dissonance. why is this so? **because in their heads, lesser evil means ""imperfect"".** not malice, but imperfection is what comes to their mind. they believe that ""lesser evil"" politics are oopsies by well-meaning individuals. but then why do they still admit that these parties are the lesser evil? to save face in front of leftist and other fellow citizens who are not aboard their platform and to manipulate them as their favorite parties commit atrocity after another towards the working classes and allying with capitalists. this is not to say that your partner, parent or a relative is an evil manipulative person at heart. they are more likely to be les because they themselves have been subject to manipulation by msm and fellow les. lesser evilism is a contagious disease. # how to counter it radicalise them by showing the evils of capitalism and more importantly teach them that democracy is not just voting, that they in addition to voting lesser evil, they should actually be criticising those parties and support labor movements and parties wherever possible. most les already understand that corporations really don't have the people's best interests in mind, but they suffer from believing that politics begins and ends at elections. that needs to addressed. i would like to point out not a flaw but rather a stumbling block in your rationale regarding how to tackle le-ism. by theoretically accepting that this kind of public psychology exists (and i will concede that it does) doesn't it run the risk of presuming that there is a ""cleaner"" alternative somewhere on the leftist political spectrum. isn't your own position then quite similar to the one you're analyzing? i personally don't think that lesser evilism can be defeated because the very notion of defeating it posits that a ""better"" alternative exists elsewhere, that is radical politics when in fact all parties have to somewhere down the line tread the tightrope of pragmatism and take decisions which will be divisive. there rarely ever is a decision made for the people that won't elicit divisive opinions so there will always be such gradations of good or evil by which even radicals would be falling into the same discourse of sanctity whereas in politics there's rarely ever room for such utopic ideals. as i always like to think, someone's dystopia is someone else's utopia and vice versa, with notions of good and evil being equally mutable accordingly. le-ism is not bad because it “temporarily stops fascism,but the masses do not understand voting is only a temporary measure”,it is bad precisely because it does not stop fascism. that is the whole point of elections under capitalism. these are two candidates placed there for us,after getting rid of any other option. these two candidates will fight each other,and argue about all sorts of politically relevant things,but at the end of the day,both people and parties are funded by the same people and everybody behind the scenes remains the same. there is no lesser evil capitalist party. the capitalists are a lot more organised than you seem to think. as a side note,congress are the lesser evil party in india according to most liberals. yet were they not the ones who organised the original ram mandir riots,or declared national emergency when the communists were getting too strong,or attacked the golden temple,etc,etc?

1e2zvlg,"class struggle there is a tendency among liberals and non-marxist socialists to think of class struggle in marxism as separate from other conflicts we see in society. struggle of oppressed nationalities, of women against patriarchy or dalits against caste in this view are separate from the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeois. this leads one to a very economistic view of marxism that marx, engles and later marxists would definitely reject. for example, ambedkar referred to marxism as a theory aiming for “equalization of property” and that which talked about the conflict between only workers and capitalists and has nothing to do with caste. since this view is very common, i would like to comment on how class struggle and many other social conflicts are connected and shed some light on what class struggle really meant for marx and engles. i will use insights from dominico losurdo’s book class struggle. **1.** **emancipatory foreign policy** for both marx and engles an emancipatory foreign policy was essential part of the class struggle. in wage labor and capital, marx referred to the starvation of ireland and many global events as part of the general class struggle between the working class and the bourgeois. both marx’s and engles’ families were highly invested in irish independence struggle and advocated for polish independence. they did not see this struggle as separate from the struggle of the proletarian against the bourgeoisie as marx even went as far as to compare the exploitation of one nation by another to the exploitation of one man by another. marx and engles saw conflicts of oppressed nations against imperialism as part of the broader struggle against capitalism. this also applies to the imperialism of current times. for example, palestine, although it is fighting the barbarity of israeli settler colonialism, the settler colonial power itself is a product of american imperial project in the middle east. losurdo draws our attention to two quotes from the communist manifesto. *history of all hitherto existing society is history of class struggles.* *the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs.* the plural “struggles”, “antagonisms”, and “ forms” signal that class struggle doesn’t always manifests as conflict between worker and bourgeoise. it does not refer to a repetition of identical, continual recurrence of the same class struggles in the same form. it refers to the multiplicity of shapes and forms that class struggle can assume. **2. genus and the species** marx and engles were not the first to discover the existence of social classes. they did discover that class society is but a phase in the development of society. this phase began with the subjugation and domestication of women and overthrow of the mother right as said my engles. thus, for marx “women’s emancipation is the natural measure of the general emancipation”. in early class society the means of production was not just land but also people – slaves. all civilizations practiced some form of slavery at some point in their history. in these slave societies one could be owned, bought, sold and used by their master like an object. the collection of slaves a man had which included his wife and children was called “famalia” in latin and is the ancestor word of english “family”. even in many indian languages the word for husband and wife are words that also mean owner and owned. these are cultural relics of an earlier mode of production and explain the existing cultural practices and social divisions of labor. this is another species of class struggle according to losurdo. according to losurdo the ‘genus’ – class struggle in general is a family of all those social forces that are resisting/ enforcing the dominant division of labor and ownership of means of production that holds together the dominant social order. the ‘species’ are the specific forms those social forces assume in concrete circumstances. these specific forms can be farmers protests, feminist movements, adivasi resistance etc. or state repression against them. marxism thus, is a general theory of social conflicts. it takes account of the multiplicity of forms in which social conflicts manifests itself. of course, individuals can develop conflicts with each other for different reasons but as losurdo says “marxism tries to analyze the social subject who directly or indirectly, pertain to the social order, to some essential articulation of the division of labor and social order”. **3. struggle for recognition.** in principles of communism engles writes: *the slave is sold once and for all—the proletarian must sell himself hourly and daily. the slave is the property of his master and no matter how miserable his existence may be, it is securely guaranteed by the interests of this master. the individual proletarian, the property of the whole bourgeois class, so to speak, whose labor is bought only when needed, has no such secure existence. this existence is secure only for the working class as a whole.* *the slave is a chattel and not a member of society while the proletarian—as a person—is recognized as a member of society. the slave may therefore have a better existence than the proletarian, yet the proletarian is part of a higher stage of social development and stands higher than the slave.* the emphasis is on the ‘proletariat’ is ‘recognized as a person’. this higher recognition as a fuller human being gives the proletariat the right to join trade unions, political parties, gives him higher dignity, the right participate in civil society, etc. in the quote engles highlights the politico-moral side of the class struggle. this applies to india as well. the rights that are slowly being diluted by bjp were fought for by the broad masses. these rights even under bourgeois rule were gained only after the independence when decolonization was the primary goal for which a broad alliance of masses cutting across caste lines, gender lines, linguistic lines etc. needed to be mobilized. of course, this politico-moral battle does not end with capitalism as capitalism and prevailing casteism, patriarchy in society still maintains oppressive dehumanizing structures which alienate the subject. lenin’s spoke of economism as that which limits workers aspirations to better economic conditions (trade union consciousness) and tries to restrict any aspiration of establishing proletarian rule (class political consciousness). economism is the hallmarks of fabian varieties of socialism like that of dr. ambedkar and it was one of the main reasons why ambedkar opposed communism. economism can be very dangerous as it can lead to one section of the working class being over exploited for the economic benefit of another. this can manifest as upper-class workers depriving lower class workers from education so their supply of cheap households helps remains intact and there is less competition for jobs. it is called trade union consciousness as more organized and privileged workers can negotiate economic benefits for themselves with the ruling class at the detriment of less privileged workers. this is why it is essential to eliminate economism and nurture class solidarity across caste lines conclusion there was someone, a contemporary of marx who did separate the workers struggle against bourgeois from all other revolutionary struggle and that was proudhon. the father of anarchism urged workers not to be bothered with oppressed foreign nations or feminist movements. but since marxism is dialectical and dialectics is about change, it is capable of taking account of the varied forms of contradictions that lead to change. good analysis op.","Extensive theoretical discussion on class struggle in Marxism vs. other social

1ajvx05,"frustrated rant with leftist academics this is a rant against academics who have found their voice only in the most obvious and physical instances of violence such as the palestinian genocide. but everything else for them is a conspiracy because there's no neat archival material that points to it. you know dominoes right? a long and sometimes intricate chain of blocks stacked in a way that you only need to make the very first one fall, one that might be far, far away from the last, with a surity that the last one will indeed fall. yeah, academics only consider it a genocide at the last domino, or maybe the last 5, if they're critical. the trouble with academics is the assertive blindness to events which do not come to them with a nice bow that says, yes this is the truth i'm fact. 1. let's look at the palestinian genocide since most people here would agree, that is in indeed happening. 2. a few years from now, all the academics sitting in the nice ivy league institutes publish about 100 papers on how ""there are two sides to the story"" and the dialectics of palestinian genocide. 3. we know that no real critical nice will come out of these because they will be shut down faster than gay was fired as the harvard president and faster than columbia removed any posts alluding to attack by idf soldies on its own ny campus on the students. 4. so whatever critique of israel comes out of there, is a nice sanctioned version. 5. slowly archives will be fabricated through the intricate chain of ""journalists"" and writers like the guy who wrote black book of communism and said that stalin killed a gazillion people and then said haha, no i was making it up. but who cares? 6. academics will publish peer on peer reviewed papers of all these asshole peers and there you have created history. 7. in about a 100 years, you can turn a whole generation. remember freud's uncle, edward bernays, the father of american marketing. in his 1928 book, ""propaganda,"" bernays hypothesized that by understanding the group mind, it would be possible to manipulate people's behavior without their even realizing it. to test this hypothesis, bernays launched one of his most famous public relations campaigns: convincing women to smoke. and don't we see that as a mark of feminism everywhere. yeah, so cool. 8. also it's like here - the gujarat board's exam question ""how did gandhi commit suicide?"" it's laughable now, but if you were to tell your great grandchildren gandhi was assassinated, they'd thing dadi is a conspiracy theorist. so what are some examples? well all genocidal tactics i've studied have started against black people. particularly as south asians, somehow racist crimes don't boil our blood ad much as nearby ones like palestine and kashmir. so by the time they happen there's been so much warning but we think it's a new kind of violence. i don't blame us - we're also a country where the work culture and inequality is intentionally kept bad so that there is literally no mental surplus to think critically about anything. students are fed whatever opioid american media is making now days and by the time they come into the work force there's no time to revise. look at mk ultra, specifically meant to experiment on black men with lsd. this is not a theory, it's a declassified doc. look at the known fact that bioweapoms were developed to give chavez cancer. there's so so much more - freemasons, bildenberg, weather modifications are all real and documented and should come as no surprise but it's embarrassing to talk about it because we don't want to be coo coo, and the reason it's coo coo because the west decides its coo coo and has enough tv shows and podcasts where only coo coo people say these things. the crazy thing is ,these are documented, but we are so afraid to imagine the undocumented history. how do we know renaissance is real and not just a propaganda to validate european ""superiority ""? why do we think money is a universal system? the native americans actively went against it, 'the dawn of everything' talks about their resistance and their contempt for europe and its silver (and how evil that the compensation offered to native americans are casinos, something that would continue to poison their culture long after their physical genocide). i'm tired and isolated. it would be great to have people who are atleast genuinely curious and critical, and willing to question their own gaps. i want to be that person and trying, but i think libaralism has eaten the left. nri indian here, but i completely agree with you. lot of leftists don’t talk about the actual kabalistic nature of the elite, and often deflect away from it, which is funny because i thought we were supposed to be against the imperialists pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will comrade. also, i dont know about weather modifications, i do know about the severe effects of capitalist production and consumption on the climate. so can you tell me sources on that ? i agree with most of the rest. additionally, i dont know if freemasons and bildenberg have a big role, the imperial core doesn't need secret meetings, their hegemony and capitalist imperialism take place in broad daylight. thanks comrade. my thoughts - this is a direct source from official government website - this one is more readable- depending on where you're searching from you'll get more material. i think the concept of looking behind the obvious is important even though they might appear unimportant. as far as the freemason and the bildenberg go, its not about just playing a big or small role. the imperial core has had time to develop layers and layers of systems and symbolism - some conspicuous and most not. the point is to not dismiss the those supposedly small elements just because they are not loudly discussed and are not the most immediate causal factors. even though you might not know what exactly is happening, you need to be real and keep your eyes open. i learnt this from the black panthers (and continue to learn this from my fellow black comrades) whose very real need for survival within a directly violent system meant that nothing was insignificant. and theory was not always right - the term ""stay woke"" was coined by black ppl as a way to say ""keep your eyes open!"" , and was later coopted by liberals and used by the right wing to delegitimize the whole thing. take greta thunberg for instance. [so many african leaders spoke about the need for climate and sustainability before her. ]( but for some reason she suddenly becomes a climate influencer. and you actually have so, so many pictures of her doing the freemason one eyed thing. it's so common that you can just search for this and it will pop up. you can argue about the utility of what it does, but symbology itself is a very very tightly controlled and intentional within the imperial core - something we dismiss because we just can't grasp why someone would put that amount of effort into continuity of symbols? but we forget that money is not a motive here. it's hard to understand that as people living in a society where artificial scarcity is maintained even at an economic loss and competition drives everything. what would you do if you had generational wealth for centuries with no regard to money, at all? what would you put your time in? we should use the theory we have been given by lenin, marx, stalin, mao but we cannot presume that the imperialists just stopped evolving and creating ever intricate structures of control. interesting","Frustrated rant against 'leftist academics' who ignore systemic issues until they are undeniable genocides.

1d4ah8g,"a brief note on how the electoral cpi(m) betrayed the indian revolutionary cause. the cpi (marxist) a political party in india currently in power in the state of kerala betrayed the cause of indian communism by siding with reactionaries. many people on the left including non-indian leftists seem to have a soft spot for the cpi(m) , many seem to think of them as the last bastion of the left in india. they praise the high literacy rates and the higher life expectancy , but what they are uanble see is the reactionary nature of the party and the atrocities they have committed. for some context : india is a semi feudal country under the grip of neo-imperialism by the imperial core. one system of opression that still persists in india is caste oppression which is based in the ownership of land. the untouchable castes (dalits) disproportionately make up the landless peasants population, while the oppressor castes generally own disproportionate amount of land, there are also middle castes who own some land but not a lot, calculations[1] by scholars nitin tagade and sukhadeo thorat, based on the all-india debt and investment survey, show that members of the scheduled castes, who account for 18% of the country’s households, own only 8.5% of the land in india. on the other hand, upper-caste hindus, who make up 22% of the households, own 28% of the land, caste isnt just confined to the rural parts of india, but also the urban parts although it’s orgins are in ownership of land, people are frequently not hired and not allowed to rent homes because of their caste in urban india too. what has kerela done to address this system of oprression? perhaps they have redistributed land ? maybe collectivized agricultre? they did redistribute land but only above a certain land ceiling , big landlords still remained. infact huge swathes of dalits and indigenous people in kerela are still landless. among the landless population, indigenous people are overepresented. you the reader might ask what offical data we have , we do have date but not on a large scale ,why? because the “communist” goverment refuses to do a caste census! it refuses to reveal how much wealth which castes have, because that would reveal the monopoly of certain castes economically. triple exclusion of dalits in land ownership in kerela[2], a study published in the journal social change, shows that low rate of land ownership by them is the result of a exclusionsary policy by the goverment! does this sound like something a communist goverment would do? this isn’t all. the goverment has also been involved in massacares of dalits. the marichjhapi massacre, when dalit refugees from bangladesh came to indian they settled in marichjapi. schools and hospitals were built and many were involved in pisciculture. a press blackout followed and survivors today say[3], huts were burned, woman were raped, wells poisoned. the survivors of the massacare still to this day have not gotten any justice. these are not the actions of a communist party but a reactionary one doused in red paint and communist aesthetics. even today, the first dalit leader in the politburo of the party was only admitted in 2022, 58 years after it’s creation, how utterly shameful. i hope by this article i am able to convince you, the reader ,why as leftists we shouldn’t support the cpi(m). sources: 1. 2. 3. > what has kerela done to address this system of oprression? >> kerela kerala aren't the wb and kerala wings quite different? the first kerala govt that tried to bring in land reforms and reform the education sector was dissolved. > even today, the first dalit leader in the politburo of the party was only admitted in 2022, 58 years after it’s creation, how utterly shameful. in a way, indeed shameful. but token positions are not effective too. > caste census it's likely going to be used by everyone else to polarise kerala along caste and religious lines. delicate issue for the left to handle, especially with growing hindutva. it should be done by the centre, for the whole of the country. > i hope by this article i am able to convince you, the reader ,why as leftists we shouldn’t support the cpi(m). who should be supported then? or is there no one to be supported? i think the kerala c p i m needs to be supported. furthermore, good leftists need to engage with them and improve them. if there is no better option to support, then who benefits from the withdrawal of support? the likely outcome is that a party that is more reactionary will gain power. again, i'm not a supporter of the wb wing. they had 30+ years of uninterrupted access to power just a few thoughts. not a cpim supporter. the left movement in kerala made many gains for dalits (which is why it has traditionally been the party they rallied around) and especially ezhavas and landless christians (few syrians, latin catholics, nadars), the lower class nairs. land reforms did help a lot of middle castes to rise up. those land and other social reforms were rooted in the movements of the marginalized castes and working classes. you can just compare the situation of dalits in kerala versus tamil nadu or for that matter the north. in tamil nadu, while they have their own identity based parties, the caste violence under dravidian party politics has been bloody. in kerala, on the other hand, class based parameters for dalits (education, internet penetration, income) tend to be higher than the rest of india but due to lack of their own politics, their interests have been put behind by the upper and middle castes. that being said inter-marriage among caste groups is highest in kerala among indian states (around 10-20%). of course, kerala is still a casteist misogynist reactionary society but we can compare arguably the caste system in kerala was among the worst in the subcontinent. teltumbde mentions how it was worse than in bengal. so the left movement from p krishna pillai to others did work even along caste lines but only at the surface level. you can read kk shailajas memoir and the various struggles of the left movement. so the current gains made by kerala are the results of the overall left movement including militant revolutionaries, dalits, etc. should not just be seen as cpim. one of my wife's uncles has been a lifelong ambedkarite, supporter of mayawati/bsp in the past, is today funnily a pinarayi stan. however, the current social democratic setup cant sustain these gains for long and the cpm being an oppressive many a times reactionary party whenever it comes into power, it needs to be replaced by a militant left movement. but it doesn't matter what party comes into power, under the current indian state they can only make so many gains. so the left movement needs to seen holistically but radical left is the way forward. the naxalites it’s 2024 man,how u guys can still think “electoralism is revisionism” and “kerela has communist government so why have they not pressed the communism button yet and anything negative that the state does,is the parties fault”? these are the same regurgitated points debunked in this very sub time and time again. ""in a way"" yeah ok. your point on the caste census also doesn't make sense, why would a left wing government be opposed to doing it if it means being better able to address the problem of accumulation of caste capital and casteism as a whole ? i don't see it. the naxalites must be supported.","Critique of CPI(M) as 'betraying the revolutionary cause' in Kerala.

1dzpxkt,"hope for india? the experiences of an indian-born american nri greetings. i am an nri. i was born in india but i moved to the us thanks to my fathers' hard work and i had the privilege to study and grow up in the us. i would come back to india during summer vacation. i had the chance to meet a diverse range of people and perspectives and also as a result i became slowly leftist and more aware of the social issues plaguing the world and the us. i have come back to india for study college after finishing school in the us. because now i have a better social perspective, i am aware of all the problems in india and indian society. failure of infrastructure, dirty public spaces, ""it's not my problem"" mindset, religious, political division, racism, casteism, colorism, climate change, proletariat struggle, and poverty are some that i have noticed. when i was in the us, my fellow classmates were mostly open and were class conscious; they were going to protests and advocating for change. here, i don't see such a movement among the youth (or i may not be conscious of such a movement). i see people caring about their own success, chasing after money, jobs, placement, exams, etc. people look at me weird for being polite or holding onto trash instead of throwing it out onto the street. among nris, almost 90% i have met see india as a burden; a place they go to to visit their grandparents or take care of unfinished business. these people, often skilled workers, want a better future for their children (which is totally acceptable), so they leave. they maintain cultural and sometimes pollitical ties back home but they seem to develop a romanticized view of india and their hometown, forgetting about the problems until they come back and visit. but it pains me to see the state of india right now. there is a brain drain apparently going on. is there a national unity among the youth in india? is class consciousness developing? will india and her people ever become better in the near future? mass cultural reformation? i have privelage being an nri but at the same time as a leftist, i want to bring change, educate, and help. thinking about all this just makes me sad. i want to help but at the same time i don't want to throw away opportunities by staying here. i still have 4 years of college to finish before i have to decide whether to stay or to go. i also have super religious hindu parents who are worried i am going this way and that i'm trying to gain autonomy. till then, i just feel so disconnected. i'm going to try reconnecting with my roots and exploring india. any thoughts on my experience, comrades? thanks for your post, there are college orgs (for eg. aisa, aisf, bscem) but due to no political groups or movement allowed in most engineering colleges, a large section of the youth remains sheltered. also, on ""brain drain"" it is not what the word implies, that some ""exceptional"" people leave india and it hurts development or whatever, it is simply that quality education and even basic education remains inaccessible for a big part of the country. additionally education is primarily designed to produce easily employable wage slaves, hence only the rich are able to become ""exceptional"". and due to the comprador nature of india, even those who dont leave are primarily contributing to the imperialist appropriation of labour and goods. (bpo firms, consulatancy firms, call centres, cheap labour and manufacturing etc..) ""brain drain"" is an agenda used to deflect from the material drain of labour and resources. thank you so much for the insight. for now, i'll continue educating myself and learning more about india. do you think there will be a shift or change anytime soon? i am debating leaving this country after college and going for a job. in your opinion, is it worth staying or leaving? i don't want to work in the capitalist system because it feels traitorous, but i think that's just a naive assumption of young me. whether there will be a shift i dont know, last elections were somewhat hopeful but we can only work for change and wait. as for staying or leaving it is entirely upto you, and working in the capitalist system or not is a choice most of us dont have. because you have to ""earn a living"". can’t help you with the question of stay or leave but i can say if you stay don’t think of it as being traitorous think of it as you have to be in the place with a problem(capitalism) to fix it(socialism). also you can leave and come back later with more experience, education, resources, money, connections and social power and use those things for good. picking stay or leave doesn’t have to be a permanent choice. thank you so much. i'm just a naive 18 yr old still figuring things out. my parents aren't capable of having this convo with me so this means a lot.","NRI student asks 'Hope for India?'.

1b9slha,"on the occasion of international women's day today i urge all of you to read the works of two great women who have had massive contributions to the socialist movement : rosa luxemborg : [ anuradha gandhy : [ transcript : dear comrades, as we commemorate international women's day, it's imperative for us, as members of the indian left movement, to reflect on the struggles, achievements, and ongoing challenges faced by our women in our society. in india, women have historically been at the forefront of numerous progressive movements, from fighting against colonial oppression to advocating for labor rights and social justice. yet, despite their invaluable contributions, they continue to face multifaceted forms of discrimination and marginalization. the indian left has always recognized the inherent intersectionality of women's struggles, understanding that gender oppression cannot be divorced from other forms of exploitation and inequality, such as class, caste, and religion. this intersectional approach is crucial in addressing the diverse needs and experiences of women across different socio-economic backgrounds. we reaffirm our commitment to feminist principles and the empowerment of women in all spheres of life. this means actively challenging patriarchal structures within our own organizations and communities, amplifying the voices of marginalized women, and advocating for policies that promote gender equality and social justice. we recognize the indispensable role of women in the ongoing struggles for land rights, labor rights, environmental justice, and against communalism and fascism. women are not just victims of oppression; they are agents of change, leading grassroots movements and shaping the future of our society. as we celebrate the achievements of women past and present, let us also acknowledge the work that still lies ahead. we must continue to fight against gender-based violence, ensure equal access to education and healthcare, and strive for economic empowerment and political representation for all women. r/indianleft mod team women’s day is a working class movement","International Women's Day post urging reading of Rosa Luxembourg and Anuradha Gandhy.

1dk3w66,"intellectual insurgency and mahesh raut by divya dwivedi and shaj mohan quotes from article [we are witnessing a pretend politics which lives on the time borrowed from a deferred revolution.]( bjp and most other political parties including the congress have continued their relation to the adivasi people through the ancient denigrate-dominate function. they have never encouraged critical, theoretical and jurisprudential discussions on the relation between the modern constitution of india and the rights of the adivasi people. if one cares to look, there is extraordinary suffering, state sponsored or directed oppression, and exploitation taking place in the adivasi lands distributed across india. through all institutions which they control, the upper castes maintain the denigrate-dominate function. the word “insurgency” is often used to refer to the refusal by people to obey orders and to recognise authority. for example, the call for a “total revolution” by jaya prakash narayan in the 1970s which was heeded by the rss was in effect a political insurrection. it remained short of what marx, in the poverty of philosophy, called “total revolution” – “a struggle of class against class, a struggle which carried to its highest expression”.

1908lio,"is it time to for a new modern socialist party? hello everyone, it is my first time in this reddit page but i wanted to ask this question, do you believe that a new organization should be created in india that represents left wing, progressive ideas and policies and can become a modern and powerful political party that counters the bjp and inc narrative as i feel their positions in indian politics is solidified and we may eventually see a two party system that might negatively affect the politics and will continue this so called name calling between each other and constant fighting that will lead us nowhere or we're screwed. cpi + cpi(m) + rsp + aifb + cpi(ml)m should merge together to form the *new* left party with the name of cpi and symbol ☭ of cpi(m). the united cpi☭ should form alliances with similar welfarism/cadre-based/non-nepotistic parties like aap. also aap will help the united cpi☭ to regain some of its lost ground from the hindi-belt. forming a new party will not do much as there is no void for a new socialist national party, there are already 4 big national parties of every ideology (except npp). centrist/composite nationalist- inc centre-right/communalism/ultra-nationalism- bjp left/communist/federalism- cpi(m) centre-left/welfarism/federalism- aap there is some space for a secular right/centre-right/centrist liberal party (like the swatantra party or swabhimani paksha or lok satta party) which will cut into bjp's vote bank and make the politics more equal and diverse. the centre right may cut its vote share but alliances exist and it would probably be more aligned with the bjp. reasons may include economic liberalism cuz why not profit over people in their piranha eyes and the congress party is weak and the fact that regional parties more focused on staying on to state power rather than expanding as their more focused on regionalism rather than creating a new national movement. the current first past the post system doesn't help the situation but also at the same time is an opportunity for new national left wing movement. with the current electoral system we're seeing less political parties and now a united states style republican democratic war which will badly affect us. sure there is the india alliance but they only have one goal and that is to beat modi(which they won't) and the alliance will probably dissolve after the election but it is an opportunity for a national party that is left wing but modern, has a clear message for the people and is more focused on policies rather that name calling some random ass mp or mla for who they are or what they look like but most important of all, a fighting force against the bjp before the slow demise of india going into the dark ages of corporate greed and bjp forming a supermajority in the lok sabha. sure the communist party can create a left bloc with other parties with similar ideas but i feel like most people but not all are disillusioned by communism and its perceived nature and the fact that media are a bunch of bjp cocksuckers will demonize the alliance. a more democratic socialist idea may be better as i bet hardly other than 10 people in this fucking country doesn't know what that is and i won't judge all of you for being marxist leninists or maoists ok but please do the same for me you are the only left wing indian political and i prefer not to be banned or anything like that. if your aren't ml or maoist i apologise i only breezed through your page but do hear me out. 1. relax mate, i'm not a maoist or am i , lol, but i am a quasi-marxist or a socialist. 2. i mean another centre-right party will probably form an alliance with the bjp but it would revive the nda and provide a space for dissent in the nda which is presently almost absent, also it would erase the footprints of communal organizations like the rss, bajrang dal in some areas 3. alliance partners do keep bjp in check as long as they are together because bjp became anti-sikh just after the (sikh party) shiromani akali dal i.e. sad left nda in 2020 due to farm laws, the erstwhile sad-bjp alliance restored the hindu-sikh brotherhood in punjab after years of sikh militancy, targeted hindu killings, anti-sikh riots etc. there is a reason that why bjp didn't implemented caa-nrc and ucc right away because bjp's north east allies protested. i understand your opinion tho, its quite rare to find intellectual people in india to have a civil discussion with. btw, you can dm me anytime mate, if your ever wanna ask/discuss/debate something.","User asks if a 'new modern socialist party' is needed to counter BJP/INC.
