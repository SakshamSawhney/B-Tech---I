l73j3b6,1d7b0t0,"Wow, what a day! I hope you guys had a great time tracking the movement of trends and results through the day.

Every election will have its losers and winners - hence it will have people enthused and disappointed by the results. Irrespective of political leanings, most would agree that 4th June '24 will be remembered as the day democracy appeared to return, from the brink.

Personally, I feel this was a good result because it reintroduces us to India's multifocal, federated politics with it's pushes and pulls. This is after a decade of delusional, force-fitted homogeneity and majoritarian narratives.

The BJP is still the largest party and can still form a government *acceptable to itself and its allies,* i.e. democracy will have played out and won.

The BJP came to power when the country was clamoring for stability, reform and growth. Unfortunately, the Modi-Shah era will be remembered for anti-intellectualist, low-effort theatre that is very removed from ground reality - economically, socially and I feel culturally too. You can do naach-gana for some time and people will get fooled - but there are limits to how long you can piss on Indian voters' ears and call it rain.",1,freddledgruntbugly,2024-06-03 18:04:48

The Opposition should make sure this happens for the welfare of our NE brothers and sisters. Also, the opposition and the goi should work together to ensure that an end is put to all tribal conflicts, be it political or cultural should be resolved. Also, proper steps should be taken that the funds sent for the welfare of NE states by the central government are not misused and those who misuse it are properly punished.

It should also be made sure that those Christian Missionaries, especially in Mizoram and Nagaland (source:- [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr-bMZwtfzo)) who want to threaten the integrity of our country are punished and discouraged from doing so.

The voters were divided like anything and all the parties played for a fixed vote bank

Congress and AAP were not in alliance and fought seperately on all seats and their voter demographic were also pretty similar including diverse group of low to middle income voters from both rural and urban areas who were anti BJP.

Nearly all of BJPs votes came from upper caste urban Hindus who were manipulated with UPs 'progress' and Ram Mandir issue. After the results a lot of them feel cheated on by BJP because of what happened in UP so their vote share will reduce but it won't be a drastic difference. 

Akali Dal has always got their fixed voter bank of the older generation of Sikhs who have witnessed the period of 80s and 90s but that is also decreasing because of incompetent party head and Akali Dal not supporting local issues because they still deep down want alliance with BJP

Your taxes are going to fund reserved category people pensions, extravagant election rallies of you know who and others, poor/reserved category ration, healthcare etc. 
There is no reality check and no reality-based minimum wage for a graduate/per hour wage. Like they have in all the Western countries 

There is no proper infrastructure and development of other streams like arts, commerce, business, literature etc
Only IT, IT IT etc 

No amount of religious chants/gods etc will come down and pay our bills. Even the money we donate to temples/trusts goes into trusts pockets and it is entirely unaccounted for and is used for tax evasion, to fill the pockets of the corrupts. How often do you hear that your religion community/temple/trust fund has helped you fund your education/expenses/rent etc? Nope!

We start with 500 individuals. 

Males start breeding at ~ 4 and Females at ~ 3
Life span is 10 - 15 Years. 

Estimating 30% of males and 50% of females are of breeding age, the population will have 75 Breeding Pairs.

With an average litter size of 3 (varies between 2-6), and a gestation period of ~110 days that's ~ 250 Cubs being born per year. Even with an average litter size of 2 the number is ~ 175.

So 175 - 250 Cubs being born each year. 

In wild the mortality rate for cubs is around ~60% and that for adults is around ~15%.

So that's 100-150 Cub deaths + 75 Adult deaths per year. 

So, notwithstanding other factors, 550 deaths over 5 years with a starting census of ~650 is perfectly normal.

kj63nyq,19dg088,"I'm a Muslim and I'll reply to this:

1.) There is evidence that there was some pre-Islamic structure with ornate architecture underneath the mosque. Temple or not, there was some structure that was presumably demolished with Shaivite carvings.

2.) The Mughals may have spent 350 years in India, but that's only because they had no choice. Babur was first kicked out of the Ferghana Valley, then kicked out of Kandahar and Herat, and then the entirety of Khorasan (after Shah Ismail I Safavid took over his former domains from the Uzbek Shaybanids). He really had no option - either get into conflict with the Uzbek Khanate, or Persia, or move east to India.

3.) Babur spent most of his time in Kabul. Reading Baburnama, it was clear that he despised India and Indians in general, calling us dirty, disobedient and unwilling to pay taxes. Kabul was home for him.

4.) Most of the Mughals, save for Akbar and maybe Jahangir, did not have much of a deep connection with India - unlike the previous folks from other Indian sultanates before the Mughals. Babur and Humayun mostly spoke Chagatai, while the rest spoke mostly Persian, even though Hindi was prominent.

5.) Ayodhya is not a significant location for us. It isn't even a tomb of anyone prominent, unlike say the Shah Abbas shrine in Karbala. But it's the equivalent of Jerusalem for Hinduism. Desecration may not have been warranted though, relocating the historical mosque to another location would have been more fruitful. Of course, such higher order thinking never passed through the heads of BJP or Congress.

6.) The building of the temple now just fortifies the victim mentality of the Muslim community. Boohoo, the mosque got demolished - but what about the fact that Mughals and sultans specifically chose to build mosques on the religious sites of other religions, as a mark of affrontery to them? We already see this in Jerusalem, where the Dome of the Rock was specifically built on the site of the Jewish temple.

It was demolished in the last century, the demolition is now a part of Indias history too. So get over it. Temple could’ve been built a long time ago but there was a civil court case, which is the standard of procedure and the decision of Supreme Court is final in India.

If we are ok with a uniform civil law in the country you immigrate to, we should be ok with it in India as well.

kyhgbhi,1by7stc,"Some of my own thoughts 1/3

**1. MSP:** A committee headed by Bharat Ratna MS Swaminathan recommended the MSP guarantee. However, the MSP guarantee was not crucial a decade ago. Over the past 10 years, farmer income has risen below inflation, and farmer distress is on the rise [^(\[1\])](https://scroll.in/article/1063427/a-decade-under-modi-farmers-income-yet-to-double-msp-growth-slows-down). Furthermore, as the central government will be selling the grains it procures, the government's net cost is not much.

CRISIL Market Intelligence & Analytics estimates that a legal guarantee of MSP for the 2023 Marketing Year would cost ₹21,000 crore [^(\[2\])](https://www.thehindu.com/business/agri-business/msp-guarantee-can-nudge-farmers-to-diversify-beyond-paddy-and-wheat-bolster-incomes-and-consumption/article67845788.ece), less than 0.5% of the Union Budget. Notably, in the last five years of the Modi regime, the agriculture budget has declined from 5.44% of the total budget to 3.08%. Modi is cheating the farmers of India to benefit Adani and Ambani.

**If farmers are affected, eventually, the cost of food for citizens will be affected.**

Traders can manipulate the market prices to benefit themselves. On the other hand, stable selling prices or MSP will offer the farmers a small profit. This will help stabilize the farming sector and make the farmers less reliant on subsidies.

The **livelihood of about 50% of the country’s population depends on agriculture** and agriculture-related activities. Jai Jawan! Jai Kisan!

**3. ₹1 lakh benefit to the poor:** As Sujit Nair mentioned, free food for the poor only fills their stomachs and does not give them the means to uplift themselves from poverty.

The next question is how much this will cost. The current government claims that 5% of the country is poor. Let us assume the average family size is 6. Therefore, 140 crore population x 5% divided by 6 = 1.16 crore beneficiaries. Thus, the total cost would be ₹ 1.16 lakh crores or 2.57% of the FY23 budget.

In comparison, Modi’s scheme of providing free rations to 81.35 crore Indians will cost the exchequer ₹ 11.8 lakh crores over a 5-year period \[1\]. In many cases, this ration does not reach the deserving and is diverted or misused.

Thus, in conclusion, it would be more prudent to help the poor through direct transfers.

In the PMO formulation, not only should the complete intake of the year be short-service based, but it would also apply to all three services**,” he writes.

“**We, in the Army, were taken by surprise by this turn of events, but for the Navy and Air Force, it came like a bolt from the blue. Naravane says** **it took him some time to explain to the other Chiefs that his proposal had only been Army-centric and that he was equally surprised by these developments.And it took them some time to reconcile with the fact that they were very much part of the new proposal,**

Naravane says the first issue to be addressed was that of retention of inductees and **the Army felt that it should be 75 per cent retention and 25 per cent released**, while the **Department of Military Affairs opined that it should be 50-50 per cent**, with the term being five years. **Naravane says the percentages therefore got reversed, with only 25 per cent to be retained and 75 per cent released.**

Agnipath Scheme! Sir you were required to comment at the relevant time. We fought our best to make the Govt understand but when our own are involved in putting the last nail to the coffin one can't help it. Silence of Cdrs leads to injustice. Desh se pahle kuch nahee. This scheme was politically motivated and was an attempt to intrude into the Armed forces. Reasons to fulfil the target of vacancy for unemployed youth as per manifesto & We are busy fighting & sorting or Silence to avoid affect on promotions. Damage has been done but can be repaired. All Veterans should be together on this issue. Fauj should not let anyone barge in functioning. **In the last 10 years, we have been witnessing the involvement of Forces in canvassing the government's propaganda. The media is working as their spokesperson. Anyone who speaks against the Govt is declared as a National enemy. Our social media accounts are put on freeze.** Hope the Govt takes this scheme out

In the chargesheet, 8 charges are levelled against the Govt and evidence substantiating the same have been provided. This chargesheet is a list of 'wrong examples' which will unfortunately set 'bad precedents' for future government's to follow and ultimately people will continue to suffer.

That was likely the reason why the other candidates dropped out.

The AAP is the only major party in Gujarat after the BJP and Congress and they did not field a candidate in Surat because of their seat-sharing pact with the Congress.

The only other candidate from a political party was from the BSP, followed by several independent candidates. These weren't expected to get many votes.

ld4t0pz,1e2zuyl,"I don't do any of that, instead I just ask them questions on a personal level.


Let's go a bit backwards and think what makes people been bhakts?


Well, most of the bhakts are just brainwashed frustrated people, mainly because of not earning much, so they usually don't have a social life or are just jealous and frustrated, BJP just uses these people's frustration and diverts it onto villainising minorities and making them look like the cause of their misery, and soon bhakts start to vent their frustration on them. Soon they feel like the belong somewhere because of this echo chamber of mutual hate towards minorities. They start hating anyone and everyone who doesn't agree with their supreme leader. This is how they work.


(Note: I know there are affluent bhakts too, but those a minority and are a lost cause, so if I ever encounter one, I just don't bother).


Now what I do with the majority bhakts? 


Simple, reverse the BJP playbook onto them. Whenever some bhakt starts speaking BJP propaganda, I skip all that just ask about their personal lives. Soon, you'll find them they're either going through some financial struggle, even if they're not struggling, most of them are living with unfulfilled dreams, could be anything,  a car, a house, a bike, trip for parents, marriage, good heathcare, good school for kids and so on. So I show them the great leader they were blabbering about, and what kind of luxuries they and their kids have, meanwhile you're just a foot solider who've been doing rhe grunt work for them for free. I ask them what are they getting for all this hard work and why are these leaders are the ones who get to have all the fun. I ask them shouldn't they also deserve to be happy and fulfill their dreams? I simply tell them to drop all these political BS and instead focus on their jobs so that they could fulfill their dreams.


Basically I'm trying to sow that seed of doubt that being a spokesperson for these leaders or BJP, is just a grunt work they're doing for free on the expense of their personal goals, meanwhile they're getting nothing in return apart from just likes and views, which is milked by influencers to buy their new shiny toy.


Job done, you've planted the seed of dissent. Soon they'll also start wondering their life choices and the leaders they were standing up for.


No ideologies involved, no political BS, no facts and logic. 


Grandnted this method won't make them turn to the other side but atleast now they'll start questioning being bhakts. Atleast they'll not be doing all that bhakt shit whenever you're around. If they do, you just repeat the whole thing again.


And honestly this is not even some cunning trick, this is basically how we citizens should be. Why should elites have all the fun while we just sit and watch them have it all, which is all thanks to the work done by manipulating their footsoldiers aka bhakts.",3,Noob_in_making,2024-07-14 11:16:02

Yes it can. We're already seeing a record low turn out in the number of people who're voting, and while they may have various reasons for not voting, it's pretty clear that the broad masses are losing faith in the electoral process. It's our job to raise the political and class consciousness of the masses to the point where they realise that they can't do shit by merely casting their vote. 

>No, so please don't waste your vote and vote to bring down the BJP. The alternative might just be marginally better but nevertheless we need a short respite from the BJP's violent agenda to actually talk about the important things you are talking about

This is honestly a very bourgeois and liberal position to take. The ""alternative"" (there's honestly none, like I've tried to show in my post) is nothing more than controlled opposition, whose socio-economic policies aren't too different from that of the BJP. Also, it's pure speculation on your part to assume that the Congress would be ""marginally better"" or that they'd somehow give a ""short respite"" from the BJP, considering that past Congress governments themselves had laid the groundwork for the ease with which the BJP got voted (or more aptly, installed) into power. Please don't be under the illusion that the Congress would ever heed to the important things I'm talking about, for the Congress and the BJP serve the interests of the same oppressor caste capitalist and landlord ruling classes. 

>It's really really difficult to even have a conversation about privatization and unemployment and wealth inequality when the other person is shouting Modi and Jai Shri Ram like a war cry. 

The phenomenon of privatisation was commenced by the Congress themselves, when they liberalised the economy back in 1991. As a result of this economic liberalisation and its consequent privatisation, unemployment and wealth inequality has been an inevitable outcome. The BJP just wishes to increase the degree to which this privatisation happens, which they seek to hide under the veil of communal politics. And there's no way in hell that the Congress are gonna reverse the privatisation policy if they're installed back into power once again. 

>Show the BJP that this stuff isn't going to work anymore. Let this anger and hatred fizzle down enough that people start realizing what government after government has done to them and then we can go for such things. 

Why just the BJP? The BJP, the Congress and various other bourgeois political parties (including the so-called ""Communists"" in Parliament) have equally contributed to the situation that we're in right now. If we're not going to talk about the need for engaging in the boycott of elections and organising the working masses of our country to successfully complete the New Democratic Revolution right now, then when we're gonna talk about it, after the elections are over? If the Congress wins, people will be under the erroneous illusion that we've somehow staved off fascism after the elections. It's important to talk about something that's important when it's relevant, strike when the iron is hot, as they'd say. 


>The damage that the BJP has done is going to take decades to recover from and the first step must be to remove it from power. Anything that hinders this, however good intentioned it may be is a crime against society at this point. 

>Please don't say anything that discourages people from voting right now!

Okay, this honestly makes me laugh. The damage that the BJP has done is the mere culmination of what the Congress has been doing for the past sixty years. You can ""remove"" the BJP ""from power"", but that doesn't mean that the BJP is finished or the material conditions that sustains its politics has been somehow dealt a death blow. If you're at all worried about recovering from the damage that all of these bourgeois political parties have caused, then the first step towards that recovery is to organise the working masses of this country to seize political power for themselves, causing the revolutionary transformation of our country on scientific socialist lines. Anything less than that is pretending at change while not doing anything to cause any fundamental changes. 

I will discourage people from voting, because revolution and the liberation of the working masses from their conditions of exploitation and oppression can't be brought about by voting.",1,ThePolyamCommie,2024-05-19 13:05:07

l4qq1yg,1cvnucz,">marx could NOT have anticipated the material relations as they exist today, and certainly not in India where they're embedded within the framework of caste.

Marx (and Engels) have been able to anticipate the development of the capitalist mode of production as it exists today, but they weren't able to anticipate the way in which the capitalist mode of production has developed through the stage of imperialism, as the development of the imperialist stage in the capitalist mode of production's development was only begining at the end of Marx's and Engels' life. And while Marx made some interesting comments about the relationship between caste and the Indian agrarian economy in *Capital*, it's always wise to remember that Marxism isn't just what Marx or Engels said, but that Marxism is a body of scientific knowledge pertaining the laws of historical and social development that Marx and Engels merely inaugurated. Limiting Marxism to just Marx and Engels, while forgetting the contributions of Lenin and Mao, is plain ignorance. 

If you're interested in understanding how Communists in this country ought to navigate through the relationship between class and caste, please refer to *The Caste Question in India* and *The Caste Question Returns* by Anuradha Ghandy and *Critiquing Bramhinism* by K.

I was very angry with the government during UPA 2. There was this constant feeling they weren't doing enough for the middle class.

But one of the first things Manmohan and Chidambaram did was abolish tax on stock market gains in their first budget presentation in July 2004.

Under Manmohan's watch, India enjoyed one of its greatest stock market rallies.

Sensex grew nearly 5x in those 10 years, despite two major slumps in 2008 and then in 2011-12.

**THOSE GAINS WERE COMPLETELY TAX-FREE!**

In the last 10, it's barely done 3x—and you're being taxed, too.

Manmohan also raised tax-free income four-fold.

Vajpayee had frozen the 0% slab at ₹50,000 for all his time in power.

By the time Manmohan left, tax-free income was 4x at ₹2 lakh.

Manmohan and Chidambaram's budgets did far more for the middle class than the BJP has ever done, whether between 1998 and 2004 or 2014-2024.

l2785tm,1ci6pj7,"*Phalodi, a small town in the Jodhpur district of Rajasthan, popular as the key centre of election-related betting, or satta bazaar (grey market), has started trimming its bets on the BJP-led government.*

*Currently, the bets are on BJP getting 303 seats – similar to its 2019 tally –from 330-335 seats predicted earlier. The NDA is expected to get 340-350 seats – less than the two-thirds majority. The Congress party is expected to secure around 50-51 seats.*

*Currently, the satta market is offering a rate of 1:1 for BJP securing 300-303 seats, meaning that a bet of Rs 1 would yield a profit of Rs 1. However, for 320 seats, the rate is 2.25, indicating a higher risk. Hence, a bet of Rs 100 on 320 seats would result in a profit of Rs 225. Sources suggest that bets placed significantly higher or lower than the standard rate are less popular in this election betting.*",7,Indianopolice,2024-05-02 04:25:46

In the capitalist west. Labour rights in the Soviet union or china or north Korea are not that great. What it comes down to is that socialism is a top down system. A few people supposedly acting for the collective pass decrees that all must follow. It is a destroyer of human freedom and ingenuity. I often listen to socialist content. Dr Wolff on YouTube. I've heard a lot about planning both pros and cons. I value human freedom a lot. And I've lost of problems with American style of politics.

You are mixing up economic freedom and social freedom this is the standard right-wing tactic where they argue that regulating private businesses will eventually lead to regulating social freedoms of people which is mostly never true Market freedoms and social freedoms are completely different.

l8ue7my,1dh4p91,"One major reason why BJP didn't 'win absolutely' was low voter turnout and arrogance.   


People who tend to left would see elections as a duty to defend rights while those who tend right see it as a way to enforce their will.  

Modi probably felt like god and didn't push the narrative far enough- no terror attacks/no soldier,civilian deaths/no riots.  Just blah, blah...   
Along with anti incumbency, he lost that golden warrior image.   



Personally, I don't think dhruv and others made much difference.  Educated people are bigoted because they choose to be.   



Muslims are used as a scarecrow to ensure Hindus unite in fear/jealousy.  But this is a 78% Hindu nation.  

14 % muslims are shown as villians along with 2.3% Christians as mass conversion machines and 1.7% Sikhs as traitors.  



BJP could be compared to crony politico who rig the system to their advantage by making the majority shackled to its ideology and minority in fear.

To: [cec@eci.gov.in](mailto:cec@eci.gov.in) 

Dear Election Commission of India,

I am writing to bring to your urgent attention a matter of great concern. It has come to my notice that during the election campaign at Banswara, Rajasthan on 21 April 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made hateful and divisive remarks towards the Muslim community of our great country.

I am deeply troubled by the rhetoric used by Mr Modi, which not only incites hatred but also aggravates existing differences between different religions. This behaviour is not befitting of a leader and goes against the principles of democracy and secularism. Specifically, Mr Modi's comments are in direct violation of the Model Code of Conduct I.1, which states *""No party or candidate shall include in any activity which may aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension between different castes and communities, religious or linguistic""*. Furthermore, his speech is a clear breach of Section 123 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 (reproduced below).

I have included links from Social Media platform X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube where the video of this incident can be seen for your reference - [https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1782039131469574601 ](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1782039131469574601 ) or  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Yll0JbtzI&t=2107s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Yll0JbtzI&t=2107s)

I request strict and prompt action by the Commission in this matter.

Yours Sincerely,

\[NAME\]

**Section 123 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951.** 

*The following shall be deemed to be corrupt practices for the purposes of this Act:—* 

*(3A) The promotion of, or attempt to promote, feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens of India on grounds of religion, race, caste, community, or language, by a candidate or his agent or any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate.*

*4) The publication by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent, of any statement of fact which is false, and which he either believes to be false or does not believe to be true, in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate or in relation to the candidature, or withdrawal, of any candidate, being a statement reasonably calculated to prejudice the prospects of that candidate’s election.*",87,TheIndianRevolution2,2024-04-21 20:36:53

Hello CEC,   
  
I want to draw your attention to the recent speech by PM Narendra Modi where he claimed that money will be channeled to ""mussalmans"".  
  
This is a clear appeal to sectarian sentiments and should be considered a violation of the electoral model code of conduct.   
  
It was later claimed that he was referring to illegal immigrants but the exact word he used, without qualifiers, was ""mussalman"" which means Muslim and does not refer to their immigration status. How a regular citizen listening to the speech is expected to understand that he was referring to all illegal immigrants in general when he used the word ""mussalman"" is not clear to me.  
  
Requesting your attention on this matter. Please exercise your discretion to punish or even disqualify the Prime Minister to the extent permitted by the law.

Yes opposition’s message of unemployment and inflation is reaching the masses and more and more people are talking about it.

Yes BJP leaders themselves realized their 400 par slogan backfired and they are not talking about it prominently in rallies.

However will it be able to make enough dent in BJP/NDA numbers to bring it below 272, which in and of itself will be great achievement of opposition considering the “UNLEVEL” playing field, is to be seen…

Regarding polarisation, the north especially the hindi heartland is an area that is constantly under religious tensions, and this Hindu Muslim talks might actually work there in order to secure their votebanks…

I mean take a look at their hardcore leaders , most of them talk anti muslim rhetoric every day and yet they continue to win 🤷🏽‍♂️

Im mentally prepared for the worst but I am hopeful about NDA falling below 272.

The moment NDA falls below 272, the Modi’s image will be dented and then BJP will have to rely more on its alliance partners (they have partnered with every party possible in the north) , which in and of itself will keep in check his authoritarian tendencies and image..

It can no longer be two man show (Modi Shah) and who knows these alliance partners and leaders might actually hop and switch their sides because one of the reasons for them to join NDA might have been to escape investigative agencies..

l1rj6kr,1cfuqyj,"Here is the survey question that was asked: Question asked: I’m reading out two statements, please tell which one do you agree with the most?

The options (and the results) are given below.



Statement | %
---|---
India belongs to citizens of all religions equally, not just Hindus | 79
India belongs only to Hindus | 11
No opinion | 10

The survey question and the options that were provided are too restrictive. They don't capture BJP's Hindutva ideology. 

I have interacted with several hardcore BJP supporters. Here is their belief system:

* Congress prioritised Muslim interests over Hindu interests. 
* An example - the Haj subsidy (now discontinued) is an example of ""minority appeasement"", but the subsidies for Kailash Mansarovar yatra are perfectly fine. Both of these were started by the Congress government, but the very fact that they started a scheme that supports Muslims makes them anti-Hindu. 

These people also strongly believe that India belongs to all religions, but their definition of equality is different. They want a state which caters to Hinduism (and Hindu interests), but does not do so for other faiths (especially Islam and Christianity). They don't want other religions to leave India, but they want them to live in a country where the majority should dictate their laws. 

This survey is therefore restrictive. 

I would instead look at the following survey which offers a better picture of religious tolerance in India: https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/06/29/religion-in-india-tolerance-and-segregation/

This survey highlights how while the majority of Indians claims they respect each other's faiths, they neither want to live with other faiths and nor do they want to marry into other faiths. The survey also highlights how the majority of Indians feel that being Hindu is very important to being Indian. 

It is these emotions the BJP has tapped into.",32,rahulthewall,2024-04-29 09:23:01

l1rh04j,1cfuqyj,"Excerpt from the article: 


>This remarkable support for religious pluralism shows that religious tolerance continues to be a defining element of the social fabric.


>It is natural for religious minorities to lay emphasis on religious pluralism. But the view that India belongs to followers of all religions is also held by members of the majority religion. Nearly eight in every 10 Hindus said that they have faith in religious pluralism. Only 11% of Hindus said that they think that India is nation of Hindus.


>What is more reassuring is that more more young people (81%) than old (73%) were inclined to put premium on religious pluralism. Although the support for religious tolerance is high across the social spectrum, educational qualifications makes a difference. Compared with 72% of those who were unschooled, 83% of highly educated people said that they were in favour of equal status of all religions.


>While communal tensions/conflicts are typically seen as an urban phenomenon, the data show a different pattern. As opposed to a commonly held belief, people living in urban settings appeared to be more supportive of religious pluralism and tolerance than those residing in the countryside.


>In sum, a high degree of support for religious pluralism and equality at the societal level points to a couple of things. First, contrary to emerging perceptions, the idea of religious coexistence and tolerance holds its ground firmly. Second, a sharp religious divide in the political realm may not necessarily reflect the situation in the wider society. One, therefore, needs to see how religion features in the electoral context and in everyday life separately.",5,ArpanMondal270,2024-04-29 09:23:01

l1rmjd7,1cfuqyj,"Thanks, that was an interesting read. I also agree that this research provides a clearer view than CSDS.



Here are some points that caught my attention: 


- The vast majority of Indians say they are very free today to practice their religion (91%), and all of India’s major religious groups share this sentiment: Roughly nine-in-ten Buddhists (93%), Hindus (91%), Muslims (89%) and Christians (89%) say they are very free to practice their religion, as do 85% of Jains and 82% of Sikhs.


- Among Hindus, a majority of those who have a favorable opinion of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) say religious diversity benefits the country (57%), compared with 45% among those who have an unfavorable opinion of the BJP.


- Roughly one-in-five Muslims (21%) and 17% of Hindus say that in the last 12 months they themselves have faced discrimination because of their religion, as do 18% of Sikhs. By contrast, Christians are less likely to say they have felt discriminated against because of their religion (10%), and similar shares of Buddhists and Jains (13% each) fall into this category.

We should be cautious in thinking this intolerance comes from hatred. The main reason I think is vegetarians get gag reflexes from the smell of meat. It doesn't mean they hate the persons. They just prefer not to live in the smell. Observe the Jain preference for Hindus vs Muslims.

Rajasthan isfamous for its colorful costumes, but thetopic of discussion is not only in its colorsbut also in its politics.Rajasthan is a state where thegovernment changes every time. People herealso support any party in the Lok Sabha.Do not give a chance more than twice. There are atotal of 25 seats in the Lok Sabha, out ofwhich seven are reserved seats, one of themis Bharatpur, it is also thehome district of Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma. Thedistance from Delhi to Bharatpur is about 200km. Mathura And due to its proximity to Agra,Bharatpur has less of a glimpse of Rajasthan than a bridgeor more of Mathura.

So what will you do for them?First of all, thedemand for protection of our Jat brothers, ifI get a chance, I will raise their voicein the Parliament, thereis election in the first phase in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, here for Jats andJatavs. The population here is the highest and thebiggest issue that emerged here was Jatreservation because the people here seemed a littleangry that despite Jat reservation being there in the whole of Rajasthan, itis not there in Bharatpur and Dholpur, that is why Jatreservation was the biggest issue here. After that,education, employment, roads,these are the basic facilities that peopleneed here, there are still many villageswhere there are no roads, where there isno drinking water, if the government gives it to them,then they will choose the same.

The point is, he doesn't need to play this complicated game to dump on the retail folks.

I am sure that the Election Commission, which claims to be ever vigilant and fully committed to enforcing the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), is fully aware that the government recently notified far-reaching relaxations in FDI in the Space sector, blatantly violating the MCC requirement (https://www.indiatvnews.com/business/news/india-eases-process-fdi-space-sector-100-per-cent-making-satellite-components-foreign-direct-investment-spacecraft-elon-musk-spacex-jeff-bezos-2024-02-22-918088)

Strangely, coinciding with a scheduled meeting of Elon Musk with the Prime Minister (PM), perhaps to please him, the Union Cabinet had an emergency meeting to announce the above-cited policy in an indecent haste. 

Had the Commission cared to issue a notice to the government and called for its explanation, the Commission and the public would have come to know of the circumstances that compelled the government to take such a hasty, inappropriate decision at a time when elections are being held. While the BJP-led NDA government may have ostensibly cited the “national interest” as usual to justify its transgression of the MCC, in reality, the decision hurts the national interest irreversibly, which the public ought to know.

Ironically, better discretion prevailed on Elon Musk to call off his scheduled meeting with the PM, while the nation has been forced to live with a decision that would haunt it for a long time. 

The public have witnessed how the Commission acted with a great deal of promptitude against other political parties for prima facie violations of MCC, far less serious in nature (example: https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-issues-notice-to-congress-led-karnataka-government-for-violating-poll-code-101701097707355.html), whereas, the same Commission has been complicit in allowing the BJP, the BJP-ruled NDA government to go scott free for far more serious MCC violations. 

Evidently, the Commission has one set of MCC requirements for the BJP and another for others!

Over the last few days, I addressed the Commission several times, to act against the statements reported to have been made by the PM, distorting the statements made by leaders of other political parties and openly invoking religion to appeal for votes. 

For example, my letters referring to the PM’s statement in Tamil Nadu (https://thewire.in/government/is-election-commission-afraid-to-act-on-my-mcc-complaint-against-modi-former-bureaucrat-asks) and his speech in Assam (https://countercurrents.org/2024/04/pms-speech-in-connection-with-surya-tilak-at-ayodhya-mandir-does-it-violate-the-model-code-of-conduct/) pointed to instances on which, if an an investigation initiated by the Commission had shown that his statements did violate the MCC and amounted to using religion for votes, they would have attracted not only penal action for MCC violation but also penal action under Section 123 of the Representation of People Act (RPA) under which it would amount to a “corrupt practice” attracting the liability of deterrent penalties (https://countercurrents.org/2024/04/has-the-election-commission-chosen-to-become-a-willing-party-to-bjp-using-religion-for-votes-in-violation-of-the-mcc-and-section-123-of-the-representation-of-the-people-act/)
More recently, the BJP announced a “mega rally of Hindu saints” to be organised at the IGI Stadium, on which I once again addressed you to act urgently but you chose not to act (thttps://countercurrents.org/2024/04/delhi-bjp-to-hold-mega-gathering-of-hindu-saints-and-seers-at-igi-stadium-ahead-of-ls-polls/)

Encouraged by the Election Commission’s silence and perhaps even willing endorsement, the BJP has since gone one step farther, openly using a religious symbol in its communications appealing for votes (https://thewire.in/politics/bjp-makes-direct-appeal-to-religion-silence-period-ahead-of-polling) on which I requested you to take firm action (https://countercurrents.org/2024/04/has-the-election-commission-chosen-to-become-a-willing-party-to-bjp-using-religion-for-votes-in-violation-of-the-mcc-and-section-123-of-the-representation-of-the-people-act/). As usual, you have chosen not to act against it.

The Commission has chosen to remain silent and inactive on each and every one of my complaints. In fact, every instance of inaction on the part of the Commission encouraged the BJP and its leaders to commit more and more violations in respect of both the MCC and Section 123 of the RPA, making a mockery of the very existence of the Commission as a “Constitutional authority”.

Time and again, I pointed out to you the “reservoir of authority” you have under Article 324 and how you could have come down heavily on all parties violating the MCC equitably, how you could have ordered the Central investigation/ enforcement agencies to function under your oversight during elections to prevent partisan action against the opposition, how you could have directed the NDA government to recall the BJP representatives from the Boards of Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) and the SBI to impart credibility to those three CPSEs in so far as they are concerned with elections and how you could have frozen the unspent amounts from illegal Electoral Bond donations lying with the BJP and others. 

The fact that you have chosen not to invoke your legitimate authority against the BJP and the BJP-led NDA government has given the public an impression that you are no more than a body subordinate to the political executive, afraid of senior leaders of the BJP, unable to act against that party and ineffective in functioning as an independent statutory regulator of the electoral process whose primary objective should be to ensure that elections are conducted in a free and fair manner.

Many of your predecessors, though selected in the same manner as in your case, chose to remain apolitical, independent and effective, gaining public trust and credibility. I am afraid that the numerous instances of inaction on your part during the last few days set you apart from them.

I suggest that each one of you individually and the three of you collectively ponder over what I have said above and the concerns I raised in my previous correspondence, attempt a self-evaluation of your role vis-a-vis the mandate of Article 324, whether you could come upto the expectations of the public and the expectations of all political parties, whether the numerous instances of your inaction make you an abettor of violations of the MCC and a party to infringement of Section 123 of the RPA and whether you can call yourself without hesitation an independent, apolitical Constitutional authority.

As citizens, we can at best appeal to your conscience but your action/ inaction will determine your credibility as a Constitutional authority.


All the best,

Yours sincerely,

E A S Sarma, Former Secretary to the Government of India

Referring to the bitter poll campaign, he said “decorum was not maintained”.

>On the surge in violence in Manipur, Bhagwat said, “Everywhere there is social disharmony. This is not good. For the past one year, Manipur has been awaiting peace. It was peaceful for the past one decade. It appeared that the gun culture of yore was gone. But the gun culture that took shape suddenly, or was created, Manipur is still burning. Who is going to pay attention to it? It is a duty to deal with it on priority.”

>On the Opposition, Bhagwat said, “I do not call it Virodhi Paksh, I call it Pratipaksh. Pratipaksh virodhi nahi hai (The Opposition is not an opponent). It is revealing a side and that must be deliberated upon. If we understand that this is how we must operate, then we must be cognisant of the decorum required in contesting elections.

I mean why would some poor guy in northern or central part of India care about what’s happening in manipur? It sounds harsh but they can’t afford to care about anything but themselves. As long as they get better basic needs for their day to day life they’ll be fine. 

And bjp knows this as well. If there’s one thing they’ve done that even people that despise the party acknowledge, it’s building infrastructure. And I don’t even mean large highways or metros or something. I mean like the most basic stuff like electricity, tap water and bathrooms. Sure even IF the government fluffed the numbers a bit the change has still been massive. Even on reddit whenever there’s a post about “why do you support bjp?” Or something you seen a bunch of people comment “I live in a tier 3 city and as far as I can remember we barely had any electricity before but now we pretty much have electricity all the time besides a few hours a week” or something. 

There’s like 100’s of millions of that guy in the country that probably don’t care what bjp does as long as they continue to do that they’ll be loyal to bjp. 

All Rahul had to do the past 5 years was make people believe he too was going to continue the infrastructure development and bring even more jobs.

Similarly UPA wasn't a complete bad time either...but some other sub with a different political opinion(aka right) would not acknowledge it....but this is the wrong approach imo...those need to be highlighted and conveyed...we should appreciate the government for that and strongly demand for more work to be done in similar vein if you want to be in power(for both opposition and incumbent) keep them in limbo and always demand accountability and transparency with performance for winning again....this would hence become a contest of who does the positives of each other better than being the usual we numba one...

They are now playing the fear factor card. So the feeling that BJP is overconfident and is blindly going towards defeat is not correct.

This election and narrative reminds me of the war of Ukraine. People mock the stupidity of Russia and if you go to world news sub, you will feel that overconfident and stupid Russia will be defeated by Ukraine. But Russia is quite nimble and make course correction as needed. Being a behemoth that can mobilise as and when need edge. That is why it is very difficult to defeat Russia.

Similar thing is here also. We can mock the stupidity of their leaders and day dream about overconfident and blind manoeuvre of BJP, but reality is different.",31,nuvo_reddit,2024-04-29 08:42:55

Also enlighten me if  they are not bleeding in every state of North. They might garner some seats in West Bengal except that every state is going to cut through their seats. They are losing 5-8 in Rajasthan, they are losing 10-15 in mp+ chattisgarh, they will lose 10 more in UP and will be reduced to 50. They will lose 20 seats in Bihar+ jharkhand+ ne. They will also lose atleast 10 in HIMACHAL+ UK+ JK+LADAKH+ HARYANA. They are also losing 10+ in Maharashtra.

In the months that followed, came the real issues of price rise, danger to the constitution etc. Had they timed the inauguration in March timeframe, it would’ve been fresh in the minds of people.


2) This is a big one. The demolitions of properties and negligent recompensation OR relocation really hurt people on the ground. Plus the hotels that are constructed around the temple belong to people from one state majorly. No prizes for guessing which one.

* The bureaucracy here has caused a lot of pains to residents, especially on fair and timely compensation of demolition of homes.
* Rampant construction is not just inconvenient but brainless as well, It has not benefited anybody in the city.
* A lot of livelihoods were affected due to demolition of buildings, new shops which were months old, homes decades old sheltering generations. Many families uprooted overnight. A relative of mine whose home was demolished partially also had his clinic demolished. Now sewer line is being planned in front of his home. He has not been able to open his clinic for six months now. That home housed 4 generations of ayodhya residents. The entire extended family has not voted for BJP as a result. He joined RSS a couple of years ago btw. Met him today, he was happy BJP lost here.
* similarly, almost 20000 homes, at least 3 voters in each home, do the math.
*  No selection and support to local economy in construction of the temple or city. All contractors and companies are from you know which state. It not like We don't have competent builders, but you know how these things work. Only daily wage laborers were hired locally.
* People here were expecting new wave of employment and business opportunities for the locals, but no such thing materialized. Graduates are working as rickshaw drivers and waiters. Any new opportunity which arose was all auctioned, so naturally was pocketed by the rich.
* Lallu singh was disliked by many, and was complacent AF. He was riding on Modi's coattails. Allegedly Yogi's recommendations were dismissed by Shah, which somehow resulted in the ground force not working as hard. Amidst all this, there is no recourse for the people suffering.
* A lot of people were sure of BJP's win and vocal about it, but there was a silent sentiment that BJP will win but they don't deserve votes. Many folks publicly praise modi but voted for the opposition.
* Massive scams in Sale and purchase of Land here, many people lost their life savings. We were also planning to buy some lands near the temple but my Dad could not make up his mind at the time, thankfully.


I would also like to clarify a few points I see being parroted all over social media. 

* Homes were not illegally built or on unauthorised lands, but when roads were being built and lanes added, the government claimed the land. Many people virtually lost their entire home and shops without proper and timely compensation.
* A lot of homes are decades old, were built on nazool lands, and thus lacked proper paperwork. When the villages here were first established a lot of land was allotted vocally. Now their grandsons and great-grandsons did not bother to get it rectified. However, I believe the government should have respected their residence regardless.
* Ayodhya bashing and boycotting is having the opposite affect here. Ayodhya is not a tourist economy yet, we are transitioning. We weren't entirely tourism dependent before, won't be any longer if truly boycotted. We have survived worse. People have never really cared for my city ever, it was always a political currency. BJP lost so the right is bashing. Before this the left was bashing us that people deserved their suffering because we voted for BJP.

India, a rising military power that proudly shuns alliances, last month deployed a frigate to the Arabian Sea and demonstrated just how much its view of the world is changing.

With little fanfare, and after decades of touting India’s “strategic autonomy”, New Delhi sent the INS Talwar on a mission to provide direct support to a US-led maritime coalition.

The frigate’s main role was helping to intercept a drug-running dhow trafficking nearly a kiloton of methamphetamines, hashish and heroin in the Arabian Sea — working in a task force of the Bahrain-headquartered Combined Maritime Forces.

But far from being a routine drug bust, this marked a strategic sea change for a country that until now has only joined international military missions under the UN flag.

“India has quietly, formally, entered a coalition,” said one western official in New Delhi. “They haven’t been sounding the megaphone and we are not trying to overly publicise this and spook the herd, but it’s a significant moment.”
The operation came as India is aligning more closely with the US on military and economic matters, in large part because of shared concerns about China.

There are naturally still limits to co-operation. India declined to join Operation Prosperity Guardian, the US-led coalition formed last year to fend off attacks by Yemen-based Houthis in the Red Sea.

But since November it has been working with the 43-nation CMF, which polices the high seas along some of the world’s main shipping lanes in the western Indian Ocean and is under the command of the US Fifth Fleet.

India’s navy — acting independently — has also been increasing patrols in the high seas around the Red Sea in recent months, escorting ships at a time of war, and in a few cases rescuing crews from pirate attack. India has skin in this game: it supplies many of the sailors on the world’s merchant vessels, 17 of whom were temporarily taken captive last month near the Strait of Hormuz by Iranian troops.

“The fact that we are part of the CMF is not just a statement of India’s closeness to the US, but also a statement of our own interest,” said Indrani Bagchi of the Ananta Aspen Centre, a New Delhi think-tank. “Our interest is not only to put our flag out there, but to make our statement that we are a net security provider in this region.”
India’s diplomatic and military independence is a cornerstone of its foreign policy, but a tilt towards the west has been long in coming.

Jawaharlal Nehru was among the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. India’s scepticism of the west has a firm foundation from the cold war, when it was rankled by Washington’s arming of Pakistan — an ongoing irritant — and found the Soviet Union (more recently Russia) a more reliable friend.

But Indian officials and analysts say China is now India’s foremost strategic threat, not Pakistan. So while Modi government officials continue to disavow the word “alliance”, New Delhi does have burgeoning defence and technology partnerships with countries such as the US, France and Israel.

India has also been retooling its military and redeployed some of the troops it had along the Pakistan border to its long, disputed frontier with China after deadly clashes there in 2020.

While analysts say the northern border is the Indian military’s rightful focus, India is also taking steps to upgrade its navy and assert its presence at sea.

Its highest-profile effort in this area is membership in the so-called Quad, where security issues are co-ordinated with the US, Australia and Japan.

India and France have also carried out joint naval patrols from the French overseas territory Réunion. India and the Seychelles held joint military exercises in March.

“Growing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean is a canker for US presence and objectives, and a canker for everybody else, and a canker for India, given the lack of transparency in China’s motives and intentions,” said Sujan Chinoy of the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.

India is projecting soft power in the broader Indian Ocean basin, too — a task helped by the presence of diaspora populations across the region. IIT Madras, the southernmost of India’s network of elite technology universities, recently chose Zanzibar as the site of its first overseas campus.

But India’s overtures to its island neighbours have been snubbed in some cases. The Maldives, which alternates between pro-India and pro-China politicians in power, is in the process of replacing a small contingent of Indian troops there with civilian officials after Mohamed Muizzu won the presidency last year on an “India Out” platform. For India, this is likely to be a long game.",1,1-randomonium,2024-05-09 14:50:08

l0ks5j0,1c9e3mb,"# Cult worship and consequences Cult worship and consequences 

on Sunday, the BJP released its manifesto called Modi Ki Guarantee. It is now abundantly clear that BJP is no longer a political party, it is the name of a cult and, with the release of the document, cult worship has been entrenched as the ‘core’ principle of the erstwhile political party.

The BJP has re-dressed the on-going programmes with all their faults and inequities, and has vowed to press on unmindful of the social and economic situation.

Modi Ki Guarantee packs a lot of firepower of the wrong kind. At the forefront are Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and One Nation One Election (ONOE). Both, or at least one, will require major constitutional amendments; but the BJP leadership seems to be undeterred.

Their first objective is **to construct a political and administrative model that will vest all powers in the central government and the prime minister**. The second **is to homogenize the population, as far as possible, in terms of social and political behaviour.** The third objective is to implement the prime minister’s ‘personal commitment’ to the so-called anti-corruption crusade that **is targeted against Opposition parties and political leaders.**

The rest of Modi ki Guarantee is a tiresome repetition of the claims and boasts of the last 10 years. **Old slogans have been cast aside and new slogans invented.** For example, **it is no longer acche din aane wale hai, it is Viksit Bharat as if a magical transformation from a developing country to a developed country had taken place in 10 years.** It is a laughable claim.

**One Nation One Election**

**ONOE is a veiled attempt to wipe out regional differences, preferences and cultures. India’s democratic structure was inspired by the institutions of the United States. The United States is a federation and holds elections to the House of Representatives every two years, to the Presidency every four years, and to the Senate every six years. Simultaneous elections are not held in federal parliamentary systems such as Australia and Canada. ONOE is antithetical to the principle that the Executive government is accountable every day to the Legislature. ONOE is the government’s attempt to wrest control of the election calendar from the ECI.**

It was a good step taken by UPA government...Sadly they couldn't privatize Air India, or else thousands of crores would have been saved..


it is counted as one of the best airports in the world today..And God knows how many jobs it has created...

As someone pointed out previously in this sub, BJP's major voteshare is from educated class (rural and urban), they don't care for freebies or caste census. They look for changes that would improve their living conditions. Rahul cannot win them with this negative strategy. 

Rahul and his sister should campaign based on what change they would bring. Also about the development works he has carried out in his constituency, Wayanad - Amethi - Rae Bareli.

His wife is about 57 years, also well-travelled abroad, and a retired customer-facing officer of a major national bank where she must have interacted with thousands of people of all religions, castes, and classes.

All very religious. Also, all of them bigoted, casteist, and Modi/BJP bhakts. 

All have always been typical middle class urban lives in major metros. However, urban environments, travel, and interaction with people have not reformed their mindsets whatsoever. In fact, they've become worse over time. Such talk was always heard but infrequently. It's more frequent and overt now, esp after around 2017 when BJP social media and mass media went full berserk.

What's interesting about their bigotry and casteism is how casual and habitual it is. They use bigoted or casteist adjectives effortlessly and frequently even in casual conversations about literally any unrelated topic. In a 3-4 hour casual gossip, about 30% of their talk will have such thoughts casually thrown in.

Negative media reports are dismissed as conspiracies or mischief. Lots of dissonance and irrationality in their talk. The volume is so much that one doesn't know where to even start addressing. It feels literally impossible to convince them to see issues rationally and ethically.

kx6yj5c,1br5bht,"From the article:

1/2

On a grey morning in north-west London earlier this month an enthusiastic group gathered outside a community centre to fly the Indian flag—plus another one featuring the lotus flower, symbol of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp). 
Some wore saffron scarves, a colour associated with Hinduism. After staging a car rally through the neighbourhood, they reconvened outside a Hindu temple. 

A British Conservative mpaddressed the crowd, praising the government of Narendra Modi. The gathering, organised by the Overseas Friends of the bjp, the party’s diaspora arm, got little attention in the local media. But footage of it soon appeared on the websites of many Indian outlets.

The rally was just one of countless such events run by the overseas branches of India’s parties, as the country’s general election that starts on April 19th beckons. India’s huge diaspora is an increasingly powerful force for mobilising support at home and abroad. Indian politicians court it for its financial and campaigning punch. As in India itself, the bjp has been more systematic and successful than its rivals. If Mr Modi wins a third term, as seems likely, he can partly thank the diaspora.

Indians abroad have long played a disproportionate role in politics at home, going back to India’s fight for independence. Many of the anti-colonial movement’s leading lights, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohandas Gandhi, spent years studying in Britain. Trained as lawyers, they used the ideas they had absorbed to argue for freedom back home. Some of the most notable post-independence prime ministers, including Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, also spent long periods abroad.

Since then, India’s diaspora has grown in size and influence. Some 18m Indians who retain their nationality live abroad, according to the un. That makes them the largest diaspora in the world, followed well behind by Mexicans (11.2m) and Russians (10.8m). If those who have relinquished their Indian passports are included, the number may exceed 32m, according to the Indian government’s estimates.

Most Indians abroad have been highly successful. In 2023 they sent home nearly $125bn in remittances, equivalent to around 3.4% of India’s gdp, according to World Bank estimates. In America 80% of citizens of Indian origin have college degrees. The median Indian household income there is $150,000, twice America’s national average. People of Indian descent lead Google, the World Bank—and Britain.

There are still plenty of low- or semi-skilled Indian workers filling menial jobs the host countries’ natives will not or cannot do, especially in the Gulf states. Yet even there the share of white-collar professionals as a proportion of Indians is growing. It now approaches 30%. Especially in English-speaking countries, today’s Indian diaspora has more cash and clout than earlier waves of migrants, who often started out dirt-poor.
What does this mean for their role in Indian politics? Most Indians who live outside India do not vote in Indian elections, as they can vote only in person in their constituencies back home. That costs too much for most of them in time and money. Only 120,000-odd are registered for this year’s poll, according to India’s election commission, and only a fraction of that modest number are expected to turn up.

In a country with nearly 1bn registered voters, 18m potential votes dispersed across hundreds of electoral districts would be unlikely to make a difference. Besides, plenty of diaspora Indians remain immune to Mr Modi’s charms. A survey of Indian-Americans in 2020 by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank, found that while 48% approved of Mr Modi, 31% disapproved and 22% strongly so. Indeed, the diaspora is much less enthusiastic than Indians in India, 78% of whom are said to approve of him. One reason may be that they read a wider variety of news than their relatives at home, where most media are relentlessly pro-bjp. Moreover, an increasing number of migrants are from south India, where Mr Modi is not so popular.

At least in Britain, those who have recently migrated for work or education tend to be less politically strident, says Pratik Dattani, who runs Bridge India, a non-partisan diaspora outfit in Britain. For many in the diaspora, Indian politics may not be their main concern, ranking behind worries about jobs, education and daily life.

The real impact of the diaspora in politics is in funding, campaigning and spreading India’s influence. As overseas Indians have become more prominent in their host societies, many have begun to take more of an interest in politics both in their new countries and back home. So political parties, Indian and foreign, are wooing them more keenly.

Mr Modi and his bjp are acutely aware of this. Their election manifesto in 2014 called the diaspora “a vast reservoir to articulate the national interests and affairs globally” that would be “harnessed for strengthening Brand India”. The next year the party’s general secretary said the bjp saw the diaspora as India’s voice abroad, “the way the Jewish community looks out for Israel’s interests in the United States”. 

Many Indians abroad have risen to the task. The Overseas Friends of the bjp in America plans to send 3,000 Indian-American activists back to India to put up posters and canvass voters. They say they will make 2.5m calls to people in India to persuade them to vote for Mr Modi. The Indian Overseas Congress, the equivalent outfit representing the opposition Congress party, has similar plans, though its organisers are vague about numbers. India’s opaque electoral-finance system makes it tricky to gauge exactly how much money the diaspora contributes; parties are rarely required to disclose the source of donations. But it is bound to be a lot.",36,imgurliam,2024-03-30 01:17:18

It is mostly seen that it is the privileged people who often have the resources to have their voice heard. The BJP govt has been able to turn these people in their cult. When you are able to influence people from the few major cities in almost every state, you get a good grasp of the population. Mostly, it is only news from major cities that is published in the  newspapers and news channels. You urge people to make reels on how the big cities are growing bigger, how we are planning for bullet trains, and how some random YouTube walks up to people in foreign countries and they praise India. With these few tricks, people think we have become the Vishwaguru.

This makes everyone forget about the growing unemployment, decrease in FDI, multi-thousand crore scams in the govt schemes, muffling the media, and squashing autonomous bodies like the ECI. We have seen the numerous scams Congress was involved in the 2000s, CWG, 2G, Augustus, etc. And we only came to know them because the media had a spine to speak openly on this. Most importantly, Congress had some level of ethics in them, and because of which, they did not clamp down so hard on the media or ECI. They tried to pressurize, but obviously it wasn't as the current scenario,  becaus we came to know about the scams in detail. 

Slowly, you lose people who would be able to raise their voice on public matters. It is relatively easy to squash voices of people from small states/towns/villages. Like the example of Ladakh. There is no news coverage, and very few people even know about this.

Narendra modi, India's prime minister, is often lumped together with right-wing populists such as Donald Trump or Viktor Orban. On the surface, the comparison is plausible. In 2019 Mr Modi told the *Indian Express*, a newspaper, that his electoral success was not due to “the Khan Market gang or Lutyens Delhi”, monikers for India’s old establishment. Rather, said Mr Modi, he pulled himself up through “45 years of toil”. But the prime minister, who is expected to win a third term after India goes to the polls later this month, is no ordinary strongman.

In most places support for anti-establishment populists, such as Mr Trump, and policies such as Brexit tends to be inversely correlated with university education. Not in India. Call it the Modi paradox. It helps explain why he is the most popular leader of any major democracy today.A study in 2020 of Britain, Turkey, eight countries in the European Union and five in Latin America by Cristóbal Rovira and Steven van Hauwaert, two political scientists, confirmed the inverse relationship between higher education and support for populist leaders. It is not universal: Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president from 2019 to 2022, was backed by some of the best-educated elites. But in America it is strong. In December 2023 Gallup, a pollster, found that just 26% of respondents with a university education approved of Mr Trump, compared with 50% of those without.

https://preview.redd.it/lov2ovk1sssc1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa72c68e072f85280f29fa5c75690f710d8cf8ac

  
Mr Modi bucks this trend altogether (see chart). In 2017, 66% of Indians who had no more than a primary-school education told Pew Research that they had a “very favourable” view of Mr Modi. The number rose to 80% among Indians with at least some higher education. After the previous general election, in 2019, Lokniti-csds, a pollster, found that around 42% of Indians with a degree supported Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp), while around 35% of those with only a primary-school education did. Polls conducted after state elections in 2023, such as in Karnataka, confirm the trend. Similarly Pew’s latest survey, from last year, shows that 60% of university-educated Indians have a very favourable opinion of Mr Modi, compared with 55% of those who do not have a degree.

# A psephological puzzle

Mr Modi’s success among the well-educated does not come at the expense of support among other groups. Indeed, like other populist leaders, his biggest inroads have been made among lower-class voters, says Neelanjan Sircar, a political scientist at the Centre for Policy Research, a think-tank in Delhi. In 2020 Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies found that between 2014 and 2019 support for the bjp increased among rural, lower-caste, young and poor voters. It grew especially quickly among “other backward classes”, which make up nearly half of the population. Among them, the bjp’s support rose from 34% to 44%, compared with an increase of 31% to 38% among all voters.This pattern of support for the bjp is comparable to other countries in which less-educated or rural people have shifted right. But unlike many of his counterparts abroad, Mr Modi has also been able to increase his support among the educated. Three factors—class politics, economics, and elite admiration for strongman rule—help explain [why.In](http://why.In) India, class is intertwined with the caste system. The bjp, like many conservative parties, is known to be business-friendly. A core constituency includes much of the “Bania” trader community, a traditionally business-oriented group concentrated in states such as Gujarat and Rajasthan. Tycoons such as Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, India’s richest men, fall into this group. Upper-caste Hindus, including Kshatriyas and Brahmins, are also part of the core support base. Some regional parties, such as the dmk in Tamil Nadu, have positioned themselves against such upper-caste groups. Congress, the main national opposition party, has championed preferential access to education and government jobs for lower castes.",40,golden_sword_22,2024-04-06 05:44:14

It may seem to be a paradox for foreign observers, because they don't know of or they forget India's ages-old caste system. Given that the BJP fights on the plank of making one religious ideology supreme in the country (even while destroying the very same religion itself!), the higher castes, who are also the elites (more education, more income, etc., on average) that were enabled by the very same religion have of course gathered together to support the BJP.

Therefore, Wald proposed that the Navy reinforce areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed,[18]: 88  inferring that planes hit in those areas were the ones most likely to be lost. His work is considered seminal in the then nascent discipline of operational research.

India is a young country: around two-fifths of its 1.4bn people are under the age of 25. That makes them an important constituency in the general election, which will end on June 4th. Getting their vote is not straightforward. Just before the election, data released by the election commission showed that less than 40% of eligible first-time voters were registered to vote. Some youngsters are disappointed with what they perceive to be a lack of economic progress since the last general election, in 2019. “I am voting for NOTA,” shrugs Jitender Kumar, a 24-year-old from Katihar, a small city in the eastern state of Bihar. nota stands for “none of the above”.

Mr Kumar’s complaints are echoed by other young Indians elsewhere. Unemployment and the rising cost of living were the main concerns voters cited in a survey conducted by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a think-tank in Delhi, in the run-up to the election. “We are told we can all be entrepreneurs...but actually there are no routes to success,” says Isha, a 26-year-old radio producer in Patna, Bihar’s capital. In the CSDS survey, 62% of respondents said it had become harder to get a job over the past five years.

A survey of people between 18 and 35 published in February by the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), a think-tank, and Mint, a financial newspaper, found that 57% of respondents did not believe that employment prospects would improve over the next five years. Although the unemployment rate has improved slightly in recent years, it is still strikingly high for educated young Indians: 41% of graduates under the age of 25 are unemployed, compared with 8% of those who had primary or lower-secondary education (see chart). This partly reflects the fact that better-educated youngsters are more likely to have family support that allows them to keep looking for jobs. But it also suggests that there are not enough jobs that match their qualifications.

Despite this, few young Indians appear to blame many of their problems on Narendra Modi, the prime minister, and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr Modi has governed India for the past decade and is expected to continue to do so for another five years. Youngsters are only slightly less likely than older people to approve of Mr Modi’s government: fully 44% of the youngest respondents (born after 1996) identified with the bjp in the cpr survey, compared with 48% of those born after 1980 and 52% of those born before 1980.

Why is Mr Modi so popular among the seemingly disillusioned young? In part, their preference for the bjp reflects the party’s general success. It has used its deep pockets and organisation to ensure that people around the country associate improvements in living standards with Mr Modi’s time in charge. It presents any government programme, whether the distribution of free grain, which 800m people benefit from, or the building of new roads and the installation of electricity and water connections, as a gift dispensed by the prime minister himself. Adverts for government handouts carry his picture; the party’s manifesto comes in the form of 24 “Modi’s guarantees”. “We are struggling, but all the good things my family has—cooking gas, bank accounts, electricity—we owe to Mr Modi,” says Siyaram, a 23-year-old who runs a food cart in Patna.

The BJP is also good at social media, where most young people consume news, says Prateek Waghre of the Internet Freedom Foundation, an advocacy group in Delhi. Mr Modi directly communicates with nearly 100m followers on X (formerly Twitter). The prime minister has almost 90m followers on Instagram, which has between 360m and 500m active users in India, most of them younger than 35. He sweet-talks Indians on his monthly radio show, short clips of which make it onto WhatsApp and Instagram. The bjp was also early to build relationships with influencers on Instagram and YouTube. By contrast, Congress, the main opposition party, has only belatedly started targeting young people through social media.

Many young people also think Mr Modi’s government has raised the profile of the country. A study published earlier this year by the Observer Research Foundation, a think-tank in Delhi, found that 83% of urban Indians between 18 and 35 approved of the country’s foreign policy. As many again saw the country’s G20 presidency, a rotational position touted by the government as Mr Modi’s personal achievement, as an effective way of tackling India’s interests abroad. Certain development policies also find near-universal approval. Though some young people may not think that the government has improved their own circumstances, they still appear to think Mr Modi has done some good for the country.

Some of their problems also predate the BJP. Job growth has been poor: despite economic growth averaging 6.4% each year over the past 30 years, the number of jobs grew by only 1.6% a year between 2000 and 2012 and not at all between 2012 and 2019. Young people are particularly affected. They have become better educated over the past two decades, yet their employment situation has deteriorated over the same period. Labour-force participation has fallen and unemployment has risen among people under the age of 30. The BNP’s manifesto vows to create more jobs by investing in infrastructure and by promoting manufacturing and entrepreneurship. But the plans are thin on detail.

This lack of progress may eventually come back to bite Mr Modi. So far, protests against the dire employment situation have been sporadic, most notably in response to an army reform that reduced benefits for new recruits. Yet turnout in the first two phases of the election has been lower than in 2019, perhaps suggesting waning enthusiasm for Mr Modi. For now, young people seem willing to give his government the benefit of the doubt. Unless he delivers on jobs this time around, they may not do so again. ■",20,1-randomonium,2024-05-04 11:23:50

> The Lancet took aim at the government’s lack of accurate and timely data, highlighting unexplained delays in the census and surveys on births and deaths. It added that India’s official figures of only 0.48 million deaths related to Covid lacked credibility in the absence of reliable surveys.

> **“Why is the government so afraid of showing the real state of health?” the editorial questioned. “And more importantly, how does the government intend to measure progress when there are no data?**

> India’s government consistently disputed previous estimates on Covid-19 deaths published by The Lancet and the World Health Organization, among others, between February and May 2022.

> “WHO has projected different excess mortality figures for India citing multiple models, which itself raises questions on the validity and robustness of the models used,” the government said in a May 2022 statement.

> India hasn’t published a census since 2011. The once-a-decade survey was delayed in 2021 because of the pandemic. A new census will likely be conducted after the elections, officials have said.

>""These claims (made by Rahul) are baseless and political. PM Modi is from Modh Vanik community. His family has been part of our community for generations,"" said Shrivansh Gheewala, president of Shree Surati Modh Vanik Samast Panch. 

>Modh Vanik people, known as Ghanchi in parts of Gujarat, number around 20 lakh.


I was groaning the moment I read that article about Rahul Gandhi claiming Modi was not a real OBC because I knew it was an easily disprovable lie and also that it would invite backlash against Gandhi from members of Modi's community as well as other OBCs. The BJP are not going to let this opening go to waste. Given that the Congress has been trying to mobilise OBCs against the BJP to counter Hindutva, this is an own goal.

In which opposition ruled state corona situation (2nd wave) was humongously better than rest of India that their party can project it on national level that we did this - None. Not even Delhi. Same with unemployment - Any State government actually talking or doing something 'remarkably' better ? 

Rahul and Gandhi family needs to step down. Like really step down. Kharge is good organiser. He should have more control.

2. Gandhi family is a quitter, not a fighter. Rahul lost Amethi for not doing anything in 15 years. How many times did he visit there after the loss to make up to the public and show that he is still theirs, will fight for them always even after loss ? He just simply left. 

Priyanka Gandhi wakes up 3 months before UP elections. Does rallies, gives good slogans and lost. After the loss, how many rallies she did, is she really struggling in UP roads voicing for public. Heck, how many times she did even tweet about any issue in UP ? Yes, that quitter fled away to Delhi. She will return to UP just 3 months before 2027 elections only to lose again. 
Why cannot Priyanka live in Lucknow and really struggle for 5-10 years to revive Congress in UP ? It takes a lot of consistent effort to win elections. Gandhi family just does optics. 

E.g. Mamata fought real hard for many many years before she won in 2011. She was even beaten many times in police confrontations. 
Nitish fought for years against Lalu Jungle Raj before winning. 

Only relentless struggle, on roads (not on twitter), can defeat a strong government. Rahul is simply 8-10 years too late. Such Yatras should have started way back in 2016 during demonetisation. And keep on trying - Not flee away when losing 1 election.

kpiev6o,1am0szl,">Gandhi's accusations came during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, where he asserted, ""PM Modi was not born in the OBC category. He was born Teli caste in Gujarat."" He further added, ""He will not allow caste census to be conducted in his entire life because he was not born in OBC, he was born in General caste.""

>The Congress leader urged the public to confront BJP workers with this information, stating, ""Whenever BJP workers come to you, tell them one thing that our Prime Minister lied to the entire country that he belonged to the backward class.""

It's already disappointing to see Rahul trying to pander to the basest, divisive caste politics for votes with his promises of a caste census and removal of the 50% constitutional barrier on reservations.

But this latest accusation is just stupid on many levels. Rahul just seems to be repeating an [old attack](https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/highlights/story/narendra-modi-a-fake-obc-claims-congress-192146-2014-05-08) the Congress has been using against Modi since 2014; that his Ghanchi/Teli caste are actually upper castes and he was the one who granted them OBC status when he became the CM of Gujarat. But it's never worked and is just an own goal because

- Firstly, it's false and this can be confirmed with a quick search. Modi's caste was [added to Gujarat's OBC list in 1994... under a *Congress* government](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-pm-modi-obc-family-centre-hits-back-after-rahul-gandhis-pm-not-born-in-obc-family-claim-5018077). What is gained from telling such an easily disprovable lie?

- Second, Rahul is throwing all people from the Ghanchi/Teli caste under the bus by claiming they aren't real OBCs and don't deserve reservations, just to attack Modi. This is wrong and unfair, especially because [according to Gujarati sociologists](https://www.rediff.com/news/column/ls-election-sheela-says-is-narendra-modi-really-an-obc/20140510.htm) this community has always had a low status and has been recommended for OBC status since the 1970s.

- Thirdly and most importantly, the BJP has quickly capitalised on this attack to portray Rahul as both ignorant and bigoted against OBCs. And to make things worse he is doubling down on his claim of Modi and fellow Ghanchis/Telis not being 'real' OBCs, even when anyone with Google can confirm that he is wrong.

>  From cooking and cleaning, to fetching water and firewood or taking care of children and the elderly, women carry out at least two and a half times more unpaid household and care work than men. As a result, they have less time to engage in paid labour, or work longer hours, combining paid and unpaid labour. Women’s unpaid work subsidizes the cost of care that sustains families, supports economies and often fills in for the lack of social services. Yet, it is rarely recognized as “work”. Unpaid care and domestic work is valued to be 10 and 39 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product and can contribute more to the economy than the manufacturing, commerce or transportation sectors [1]. With the onslaught of climate change, women’s unpaid work in farming, gathering water and fuel is growing even more.

> Policies that provide services, social protection and basic infrastructure, promote sharing of domestic and care work between men and women, and create more paid jobs in the care economy, are urgently needed to accelerate progress on women’s economic empowerment.

kvxmo5g,1bk9q0y,"PM CARES is completely built upon the donations of the common people. It was launched during the pandemic. According to its website, it had collected ₹10,990 crore till March 2021. It was promised that ₹100 crore rupees will be allotted for vaccine development. That did not happen. Moreover, only one-third of that ₹10,990 crore was spent. During the most distressing times — especially during the time when India's healthcare system collapse — a public fund was unable to spend money. People literally died due to dearth of oxygen cylinders. All public funds under the government are required to be audited by the Auditor General of India, but PM CARES has been exempted out of any audit. Media barely covered this not-so-transparent fund and showed zero interest in finding out how public money might have been misused. Plus, after 2022, the PM CARES website was not updated with any financial statement that could provide details about its treasury.

Recently, details of electoral bonds as revealed by SBI revealed that ₹12,000+ crore was donated to BJP. Many companies among the donors were loss making companies and the party was also found to accept overseas — when both are clearly illegal by law. More details on this will release with time as the data released is slowly refined and sorted. No big media house is covering this; they and the Opposition are just playing blame games.

Gautam Adani is a huge name in business internationally. Hindenburg Research, a US-based think tank, published a report on Adani and his companies. Adani was found guilty for mass manipulation in stock market and illegal shell companies organizing unfair trade practices overseas. It was 1.4 lakh+ crore scandal. ₹1400000000000! Adani-Hindenburg scandal was also not given much importance. Appears that this much amount was too less for the Indian media — even though this news was highlighted all around the globe. And now, Adani has also been found to donate few hunred crores to BJP through electoral bonds; please note that electoral bonds are not the only medium to donate to a party. Funny, right!?

- I just read an excellent piece in the Economist(an international magazine that I highly recommend for their surprisingly nuanced analysis for regions like the Middle East, South Asia etc) that suggests the Indian educated classes do actually find incidents like Kejriwal's arrest and the tax raids against the Congress to be a turn-off, but have convinced themselves that ""the good outweighs the bad"" about strongman Modi, at least for now.",384,1-randomonium,2024-04-01 17:06:02

---

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s arrest was months in the making, with him refusing to appear in front of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for nine consecutive summons. When it happened — the arrest of a sitting Opposition Chief Minister in the lead-up to a national election — a watershed moment in the history of Indian democracy seemed all too prosaic.

Delhi went about its business as usual. Politicians tweeted their reactions along predictable lines. Courts were moved with predictable results. The BJP and Opposition supporters argued in various arenas about authoritarianism and corruption. A WhatsApp group of senior public policy and government affairs professionals — a niche set of individuals particularly attuned to and connected with state power — discussed the possibility of traffic jams affecting their day’s programmes. Others reassured that the roads were clear.

It is too soon to predict how this will ultimately play out but some observations are pertinent. First, there’s an unmistakable sense of isolation of the political class. People have opinions about various developments within the political class but as detached observers. The ED raids on Opposition leaders, the freezing of the Congress party’s bank accounts and the arrest of two sitting CMs (Jharkhand CM, Hemant Soren resigned in anticipation) are watched with dispassionate interest — without feeling like these developments have any bearing on their own lives.

It is not difficult to see how we have arrived at this point. Political parties have evolved into closed clubs where the average person has very little visibility in decision-making, let alone influence. Moreover, the political class is seen to be self-serving and the basis of the relationship between political parties and people has become transactional with the expectation of well-defined economic benefits from voting one party or another into power. This is neither a unique nor durable foundation for substantive affiliation between specific political parties, its leaders and the people.

This has a direct impact on the nature of our democracy. Representative democracy is operationalised through political parties. However, if there is a popular disconnect with democracy’s primary institutional intermediary, then it ceases to be seen as a public good. The inevitable result of this is a thinning conception of citizenship and voter apathy. We can then provide all the information in the world but there is no path to popular investment in democracy without fixing disenchantment with the political class. A sense of personal stake in representative democracy requires not just information but engendering the feeling that the political parties/leaders in question are custodians of their personal interests and thus truly their representatives in Delhi.

Liberals like us may prattle on about the virtues of democracy at large but India’s only liberal political party too suffers from this popular disconnect. This is because the basis of Indian liberalism typically has been institutionalism and the espousal of tolerance and social welfare instead of a normative vision which can provide people clarity, identity and community. In the absence of personal affiliation, abstractions about democracy often have little bearing on people’s daily lives. There is no doubt that the democratic space in India is shrinking, but this abridgement is targeted. It is thus most keenly felt by the beleaguered minority or on the margins by those who are directly in the crosshairs of the government, such as the Opposition, media and activists. For the rest, the difference, if any, is marginal. The daily wage worker, the peon, the domestic worker, the auto driver who gets slapped around for collection by the policeman have always known arbitrary power and are unlikely to experience a difference in their life unless they are directly engaged and politicised. Even for those at the top who may directly interface with political actors, most people just put their heads down and carry on through a mix of opportunism and sycophancy. This is likely what they would have done in a more expansive democracy as well.

The popular disconnect with the political class may explain why the BJP is preemptively knocking out its opponents in a contest it was slated to win anyway. Likely, the electorate at large will not be incensed enough by this predatory behaviour to impose a high political cost on the BJP. On the other hand, there are significant advantages of consolidating political power, not least the ability to implement its full ideological agenda and position itself for the long term by eviscerating the Opposition. This doesn’t bode well for our country going forward because the willingness of the BJP to undermine its own democratic legitimacy removes the last check — self-restraint — on its abuse of executive power.

Finally, what does it mean for the Opposition going forward? It would be hyperbole to predict the demise of Indian democracy irrespective of the outcome of the national election in 2024. Our country is too large and federated to be suppressed in one shot. Its expanse and diversity will always provide spaces for democratic action even when institutions falter. However, the Opposition must find a way out of its isolation through a deeper connect with people’s lives.

But it isn't comparable to what happened to the Shiv Sena or what is happening here from the looks of it.

With political parties having quasi-constitutional status due to the X Schedule, who gets to be called the party is a key issue. And fundamentally the only way to resolve it is to assess who the majority of elected representatives back. And have the party's own constitution and by-laws be consistent with the regulations set by the EC to avoid these sorts of shenanigans.

The simple fact is that in the Shiv Sena issue, the majority of MLA's and IIRC even the few MPs backed Eknath Shinde. And similarly here it looks like the majority of the party's elected reps are behind Ajit Pawar. So why should the EC ignore them? We created this mess with the provisions of the anti-defection laws and the need to ensure that party purity is maintained as a legal concept. Within that framework who is the party is a vital legal question.

kp80sbl,1akclqr,">The part that broke away

But how do you determine *who* is the breakaway. What the EC is doing is exactly that.

The Party Leader, even a founder, can himself become alienated from the majority of a party. The Party, insofar as it is a quasi-constitutional entity, isn't the personal property of someone. So who is the breakaway?

The concept of defection carries with it the idea that the ""break away"" group are the ones who are the minority. The heterodox. That can include the original founders or party ""big names"" too. And it is for the EC to decide who constitutes the breakaway faction in this situation.

In both the SS and now the NCP case, the EC looked at the facts and assessed who the majority was. And how should that majority be decided? The logical, and frankly legal, way is to see who the majority of the elected reps of a party support. Because ultimately under the constitution what matters is a party's whip to its elected members. And that whip should logically belong to the *majority* of those in the party's caucus. Imagine if the Party Leader could expel 40 or 50 MLAs in his party and leave himself? Wouldn't it be more logical for the leader to be the one who has ""defected"" and is thus the one to be expelled?

The symbol, and electoral properties of a party will remain with the majority group. That is the logical conclusion. In the Shiv Sena that was assessed to be Eknath Shinde. And now in the NCP's case it appears to be Ajit Pawar's faction.

The EC in both cases appears to have acted perfectly reasonably. It would be unreasonable to do the opposite, and empower a minority *over* a clear majority of legislators in a party. 

The other faction, the minority faction, is now considered a breakaway group and is free to come up with their own party name and symbol. As is the case when someone breaks away from a party.",22,boringhistoryfan,2024-02-06 15:37:10

EVEN AS Sena (UBT) continues to insist that Uddhav Thackeray be projected as chief ministerial face of Maha Vikas Aghadi for the ensuing Assembly elections, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar today rejected any such idea.

“Our alliance is our collective face. One individual can’t become our CM face. Collective leadership is our formula,” Pawar told reporters in Kolhapur today when asked about Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s insistence on Uddhav Thackeray as CM face of MVA.

Pawar said discussions regarding polls are yet to take place. “We have not yet discussed anything about Assembly elections. All three alliance partners will take a decision in this regard,” he said.

Calling for including all the other parties and those opposed to PM Narendra Modi in MVA, Pawar said, ”During the recent LS elections, the PWP, AAP and Communist parties helped us. Though we are three partners in MVA, we should include all these parties. All those opposed to Modi should become part of MVA. Whatever the decision regarding the CM face, it will be taken after discussion and after taking everyone into confidence,” he said.

Two days after calling for making Uddhav Thackeray, the CM face, Raut today again emphasised that if MVA goes ahead without a CM face, it will be hit adversely in the Assembly elections which are likely to be held in October. “It will be wrong on the part of MVA to go ahead without a CM face. If a CM is projected, it will create a positive atmosphere in our favour, and help get more seats. Otherwise we will be pegged on the backfoot,” he told The indian Express. 

Earlier this week, Raut caused quite a buzz in political circles when he pitched Uddhav as the CM face of MVA.

”Going to elections in Maharashtra without a CM face will be dangerous for MVA. Maharashtra has seen how Uddhav Thackeray has handled the state, especially during the crucial Covid period. People voted for MVA due to his popularity. A faceless alliance will not help our cause,” Raut had said two days back.

Today, Raut cited INDIA bloc’s performance and an absence of the PM face to drive home his point. ”If INDIA bloc had projected Rahul Gandhi as the PM face, it would have got 25-30 more seats. No government or organisation can remain without a face. People must know who they are voting for. People voted for Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi.

They want to know the face. We don’t have differences over who should be our CM face. We are determined to contest unitedly and will win 175 to 180 assembly seats,” he said.

When asked whether Thackeray was ready to be the CM face, Raut shot back,”You can pose that question to him (Uddhav).”

Raut said the matter was open to discussion. “We will take up the issue at the MVA meeting and arrive at a consensus. But I will continue to back Uddhav because of his popularity among the masses,” he said.

kqsb8yb,1aspawi,"I personally don’t think MSP is really a problem. But I feel like it should be accompanied with taxation for farmers above a certain income(same as salaried folks above 5Lacs). It would probably cut down a lot of the additional burden. And before people say that such farmers are too few, let’s remember that while less 5-6% people pay income tax they end up contributing around 20% of revenue for the government.

But the moment any government introduces taxations for farmers(no matter how rich), they will loose the next election. So don’t think this topic really has a good solve without funding one more freebie and taking it up as an additional permanent expense",232,Mental_Ad4635,2024-02-17 01:10:21

Your calculation itself has got 1.3% of budget just on MSP going by farmer demands.

You forget to add these to the list
1) Loan waiver cost
2) Subsidised electricity cost
3) Loss on Tax revenue
4) Subsidised other agriculture related necessities.

Now what a higher MSP also does is raise cost of all crops in the market. So it will not encourage more buying of Indian cereals but actually reduce purchase of all crops. Total food inflation is going to drastically increase. Now imagine what a poor labourer who is not into farming going to do with such prices. 

Now the procured crop government has to sell. If it cannot sell at profit further adds cost. More fiscal deficit.

That is why, what the economist say is right and not just simple math calculation done in this article which even a 12th pass can do.

The main problem with farming is the middle men, misuse of loans, environmental issues, lack of diversification in crops, no improvement in farming techniques etc.

MSP is justifiable but at much lower levels than what it is being demanded.

kqs53ft,1aspawi,"Am going to repost an old comment of mine.

Before we romanticise the life of Indian farmers, let’s acknowledge a few facts. Let’s start with a few structural challenges on the farming.

1.	⁠The average farm size in India is 2 hectares. And with every generation, it is getting fragmented further. Under no reasonable scenarios, this is sufficient to keep a family of 5 above poverty levels.
2.	⁠Low Productivity: limited irrigation (less than 60%), low yield per acre (compared to Europe and China) for most crops (cotton, sugarcane etc seem to be exception) due to input quality and farming practices.
3.	⁠Price Risks: farm produce is a commodity and hence prices swing wildly based on demand and supply. Also the governments have incentives to keep prices affordable to manage retail inflation. High tomatoes and onions prices have brought down governments.
4.	⁠Perishable commodity: without infrastructure and packaging/processing to enhance shelf life, farmers have to sell at spot prices and often do not have an option to wait for better prices later on.
5.	⁠Fragmented Inefficient Market aka Mandi system APMC: movement of agricultural goods across state and sometime APMC boundaries is heavily regulated.
6.	⁠Inefficient value chain: The Indian farmer receives just 10% to 23% of the price the Indian consumer pays for exactly the same produce, the difference going to losses, inefficiencies and middlemen. Farmers in developed economies of Europe and the United States receive 64% to 81%. Take these numbers with a pinch of salt (pun intended) to exclude staples like wheat and rice.
7.	⁠Availability of Credit: Farmer loans are bad business for banks. Besides the regular credit risk of price and yield uncertainty, politics of loan waiver discourages organised sector from lending to farmers.

Now let’s talk about some solutions by accepting that there is no silver bullet to the malaise in agriculture and agreeing on a goal - India’s GDP per capita needs to double to $4000 and farmer should be able to participate at this average. Assuming a nuclear family size of 5, that’s 14LPA goal. Current average estimated income for an agricultural household is 1.2LPA. So the goal is 12x.

1.	⁠We need to accept that Indian economy needs to shift away from agriculture. There is no way we can guarantee a sustainable income to farmers with less than 2 hectares farm size. Even if farm yield doubles and irrigated land is maximised, 14LPA is not a reasonable target. Every marginal farmer knows that his next generation cannot bank on the family farm for survival.
2.	⁠Let’s see what a workable plan looks like. 2X on farm yield, 2X on farm size, 3X on % of final price captured by farmers. That’s 12X.
3.	⁠That means, 50% of next generation of farmers need to be transitioned to a different sector of the economy - manufacturing and service.
4.	⁠Farming needs to modernise and become sustainable (seed quality, water management, fertiliser etc) to double the yield.
5.	⁠Shift the value chain in favour of the farmer. Structural reforms in agriculture trading, better infrastructure to reduce waste etc.

Experts know what needs to be done. But the leadership to do this requires making hard decisions. But then best parents give the child what she needs (green vegetables and education) and not what she wants (only chocolates and playtime).

PS: Any sustainable solution has to be a market based solution. Welfare and subsidies can be the pain relief but should not be mistaken for a cure for commercial private enterprise that farming eventually is.",127,M1ghty2,2024-02-17 01:10:21

If govt would just accept this demand it will increase the agri loans and nobody is going to pay it back backing on another protest to force the govt to write off their own loan. It's a bad precedent to set.

This is also coming from someone who actually supports this demand of farmers! But rather than writing a blank cheque take it in a case by case basis.

**Edit: Translation**

Whatever movement/protest it is, it has a certain power. It’s the power of masses. Now, government has to stay aware of this power, that normal populace do not face difficulties because of that movement, that law & order keeps working and not get affected by that movement. 

Like when a medical community goes on a strike, there’s always a chance that some patients will die. It doesn’t mean that it is to be announced that doctors are enemies of patients. It doesn’t mean that doctors do not hold right to protest. It’s the responsibility of an elected government to ensure that no patient dies and that it persuades doctors to not go on strike. Because, people have elected their government not doctors. 

One needs to understand this core point. 

Now about how the protestors are being painted with a negative brush about their intent. Who blocked the roads for the first time? Not farmers. Nails were hammered into the roads, big cemented blocks were placed, we haven’t seen this happening anywhere in the world. So, in effect, traffic jams were effected by Indian government. What right do they have to create traffic jams?

Punjab/Haryana High acourt is asking what right does goverment have to block roads and create traffic jams?

So, this first wrong was done by Indian government. 

Now, if tractors are being modified to tackle those barricades, is government responsible for those modifications or those protestors? (Rhetorical)

Why did they effect such barricading? What right do they have to not allow protestors to enter Delhi, to not let them walk on roads, do they own Delhi? Does Delhi not belong to farmers? Does it not belong to common people? 

***But we won’t allow them to enter Delhi***

What is this resolution? This resolution itself is undemocratic. 

Government likes to talk about bulldozer justice. 

(Addressing Reporters)

*You are reporting against government, are being critical about it, so government can decide to bullldoze your home. If we break Section 144, it can bulldoze our homes. Why is it so? You can’t even ask because it’s bulldozer justice.*

When central government justifies bulldozer justice as a form of justice, then what do you expect from common people?

Movement/Protest happens to break some kind of law. Protest cannot happen while keeping Section 144 in mind.

(Mocking tone)

*Come organise in a single queue, in a disciplined way, and enter Delhi.* 

Protest happens to bend government, to force them to talk, to reach a consensus. It’s a kind of pressure. 

Which political party in this country hasn’t served as an Opposition? Did they never protest while they were in opposition? Can they confirm that there was no violence in their protests?

Violence did happen. And it was tolerated too. Protestors were sent to jail. Cases were filed. But they never stood and protestors were released because nature of violence in protests is taken as of crime. 

Why? Because protests happen when society wants a certain system. 

Why is ***this protest*** happening? What new ask do they have? All these demands have already been approved by Indian government in the past. 

This is not a “Demand” protest. It’s a “Fulfillment of promises“ protest. Now they’re made to protest even for fulfillment of promises? 

What you have already committed - that you pulled black laws back, that you will get new MSP made - there have been n munber of meetings to discuss MSP - no one in India knows about those meetings - now you’re saying that you need more time. So instead of electing you for five years, should we elect you for fifty years? And then you think that you’ll get elected again? You won’t be. 

You need to give a solution in this term only. And that’s why citizens are on the street. 

You are antagonizing protestors all the time. On the one side you’re having conversation with them and on the other you are throwing tear gas on them in night? What sense does this make? Is this a fight between Israel and Hamas? And after all this negative and antagonizing atmosphere that you have created, if someone gets agitated and reacts against you, you start calling them anti-nationals? 

Anti-nationals are those who bomb (read tear gas) their own citizens from the sky. This is an undemocratic government. This is a citizen-hating government. And citizens will give answer to them.",60,--5-,2024-02-22 17:32:09

krk7zo3,1awx3qb,"From the article:

X (formerly Twitter), owned by billionaire Elon Musk, has confirmed compliance with executive orders issued by the Indian government demanding the suspension of specific accounts and posts that are allegedly associated with the farmers' Delhi Chalo protest. 

The social media company has expressed its disagreement with the Indian government's directives and emphasized its commitment to freedom of expression. 

“The Indian government has issued executive orders requiring X to act on specific accounts and posts, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment,"" the official Global Government Affairs account of X wrote on the microblogging site. 

“In compliance with the orders, we will withhold these accounts and posts in India alone; however, we disagree with these actions and maintain that freedom of expression should extend to these posts,"" it said. 

The Global Government Affairs also informed that a writ appeal challenging the Indian government's blocking orders remains pending. “We have also provided the impacted users with notice of these actions in accordance with our policies.""

Due to legal restrictions, X said it is unable to publish the executive orders but said that making them public is essential for transparency because the lack of disclosure can lead to a lack of accountability and arbitrary decision-making. 
This came after the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) finalized its emergency order directing top social media companies like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), and Snap to block 177 accounts and links related to the farmers' protest to maintain 'public order’.

MeitY issued the emergency orders at the behest of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and these were in addition to the final orders issued on 14 February. The report notes that both the blocking orders issued on 14 and 19 February are conditional and have been issued till the duration of the protest, after which the social media companies can restore these accounts and channels.

The orders were issued against 35 Facebook links, 35 Facebook accounts, 14 Instagram accounts, 42 X accounts, 49 X links, 1 Snapchat, and 1 Reddit account. Notably, while it is common for the government to take down Facebook and X accounts, this is the first time the Centre has issued a blocking order against Snap.",42,imgurliam,2024-02-22 04:10:32

New Delhi: A daughter of agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan said at a government function on Tuesday (February 13) that India’s farmers cannot be treated as criminals.Madhura Swaminathan, an economist, was addressing a function at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) held to celebrate the conferment of the Bharat Ratna, which is India’s highest civilian award, to the senior Swaminathan.

She referred to news reports of agitating farmers being prevented from reaching Delhi and said the country’s scientists have to consult the farmers and not treat them like criminals.“

The farmers of Punjab today are marching to Delhi. I believe, according to the newspaper reports, there are jails being prepared for them in Haryana, there are barricades, there are all kinds of things being done to prevent them,” Swaminathan said.

“These are farmers, they are not criminals,” she continued to say before being applauded by the audience.“

I request all of you, the leading scientists of India … [inaudible] have to talk to our annadatas [a word in some Indian languages used to refer to farmers], we cannot treat them as criminals. We have to find solutions.“

Please, this is my request. I think if we have to continue and honour M.S. Swaminathan, we have to take the farmers with us in whatever strategy we are planning for the future,” Swaminathan concluded her address by saying.

Various farmer groups are participating in a march to Delhi to demand, among other things, floor prices for their crops and debt waivers. 

Some estimates have pegged the number of participating farmers at nearly one lakh.Police in Haryana fired tear gas against protesting farmers on Tuesday and police in the capital have barricaded the city using razor wire, concrete blocks and fencing to prevent the farmers from reaching there.

Some farmers have also alleged that the police fired rubber bullets at them.

The developments come days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Union government was posthumously conferring the Bharat Ratna to M.S. Swaminathan “in recognition of his monumental contributions to our nation in agriculture and farmers’ welfare”.

M.S. Swaminathan is recognised for leading the Green Revolution in India, which saw the adoption of technologies that increased crop yields and alleviated the country’s food scarcity problems.

R.B. Singh, a scientist who was also present at the IARI function and who was part of the Swaminathan Commission that studied farmer distress in the mid-2000s, was cited as saying by NDTV that Indian farmers need a new law on minimum support prices (MSP).“

For farmers to get the right price for their crops, it is necessary to make a new law on MSP in the country to properly implement the recommendations of the commission,” NDTV quoted him as saying.

Singh also told the TV channel that a system recommended by the panel, where MSPs would be fixed at levels at least 50% higher than the cost of producing a crop, “has not been implemented in a uniform manner in the country”.",-3,imgurliam,2024-02-14 11:59:27

There is insurance for crops,  farmers have to pay only 2% of premium, the center has said that the state can even pay that 2%. The rest is completely paid by center and state. 

There is a pension scheme for farmers, a farmer, age 18-44, can sign up for it, and they will get 3000 p/m or 36000 per year after the age of 60. The farmer needs to contribute 200 per month. it can be even lower if he starts early

Patel, also the spokesperson of the Gujarat government, posted on his X handle BJP’s promotional video praising PMFBY,

The Centre had rolled out PMFBY in 2016. In August 2020, the BJP government in Gujarat, led by Vijay Rupani, opted out of PMFBY citing “high premium” quoted by insurance companies.

Pal Ambaliya, chairman of Gujarat Kisan Congress wondered if Patel didn’t know that PMFBY is no longer available to farmers in Gujarat. “How can he sing praise on Twitter of a scheme which is no longer available? Doesn’t the minister know this much? Or as has been the tradition of BJP, he is lying,”

1/2

Farmers are back on the march, and the government as usual is back on the defensive while TV channels and newspapers are full of experts explaining why the farmers’ demands are unrealistic and impractical. 

Their reasons range from - ‘India simply doesn’t have enough money’, to ‘where are the warehouses required to store all that produce?’

There are also those who oppose it on ideological grounds -- ‘Why should the farmers be insulated from the vagaries of the market?’,  ‘Linking their income to demand and supply will encourage productivity and innovation’ and so on. Minimum support prices and public procurement, they point out, are Soviet-era tools that have been proven to be inefficient and useless.

Yet, amid all this, author, researcher, farmers' rights activist and former journalist Devinder Sharma stands apart as a voice staunchly in support of the agitating farmers.

Sharma, the author of books such as GATT to WTO: Seeds of Despair and In the Famine Trap, spoke to The New Indian Express on why he supports the farmers’ demand for MSP, and addressed the various objections against it.

Q - The biggest objection to the demand for MSP is that we don’t have enough resources. Government sources claim that implementing the MSP scheme will cost Rs 10 lakh crore per year, equal to our total expenditure on infrastructure. Similarly, they argue that the government doesn’t have the warehouses to procure all agricultural items, only grains and pulses. How do you address these objections?
A - I am not asking the government to procure everything. That’s a kind of an illusion they are creating, to create a fear-psychosis. 

We are saying, make MSP a legal instrument. This does not mean that the government will procure everything.
MSP will be a benchmark price below which nobody will purchase, whether it’s the agent, private traders or public agencies. So, the government doesn’t have to come into play. Only at certain times, government's intervention may be required.

Q - How exactly will this system work? What happens when there’s too much produce in the market and there are no takers for the excess produce at MSP? Who will buy the excess produce?
A - When such a situation takes place and farmers are not able to sell their produce, the government must pay the farmers.. That’s an intervention that is required. Even in a country like America, when the milk is surplus, what do they do? They feed it again to the cows or throw it, but farmers are paid. They also ask farmers to convert it into cheese which is distributed in the schools or sold. The government compensates farmers in such cases.

Q - Where will we get Rs 10 lakh crore from?
A - [The figure of Rs 10 lakh crore] is misinformation. The government doesn’t have to purchase everything that is produced in India. It has to step in only when prices crash and farmers are forced to sell their produce below the set price.
We have got the studies which say very clearly that if the government intervenes at that level when prices dip too much, it’s not going to be more than Rs 1.5 lakh to 2.0 lakh crore every year. The Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission too says the same.

However,  a CRISIL study examining 16 of the 23 crops for which MSP is announced says the real cost to the government will be Rs 21,000-crore for the marketing year 2023.

Q - But still, is that the right use of taxpayer money?
A - When you announce an economic stimulus to corporates, do you ask these questions? Do you ask where the money has come from? The Rs 15 lakh crore that has been written off by banks as bad loans, is that not a kind of an economic stimulus? But when it’s farmers’ turn, everybody starts jumping up and down saying where will the money come from.

Everyone else has income security. Look at how you deal with government employees. For them, you have set up a system that lays out the kind of salaries that have to be fixed after a few years gap. We had the 7th Pay Commission, and it cost an additional expenditure of Rs 4.5 lakh crore when it was implemented across the country. No one asked from where the money will come from. It is all assured income and guaranteed pay. But when it comes to farmers, all kinds of questions are used. You want to leave them at the mercy of the market, demand and supply. Markets have failed to provide an assured income anywhere in the world.

How long do you want farmers to continue suffering, dying and committing suicide? Is 75 years not enough? Since the National Crime Records Bureau started compiling the data on farmer suicides, nearly 4-lakh farmers have committed suicide, and you are still singing the praise of the markets? Markets have failed everywhere in the world, why do you think such a failed model should be brought into India...Are we worried that if the farmers get higher income, corporate profits would be reduced?

Give them a guaranteed minimum price. Whatever income they generate, they are going to spend it. It will in turn generate huge demand in the economy. The wheels of the development will run faster. If you give farmers a legal MSP, the economic growth will jump to the double digits immediately.

Q - Another related argument – particularly from the side of the industry – is that the kind of money that is being spent on income assurance for the farmers can be better utilized to create storage infrastructure by the government, and this storage infrastructure can be used to store the produce during times of excess and low prices. What do you think of that idea?
A - If the corporates are so keen on this idea, pay the MSP to the farmers, purchase the produce, store it or do whatever you want. Farmers will have no problem.",2,imgurliam,2024-02-17 18:46:35
kqvk13i,1at9228,"2/2

Q - There is also a fear that if the farmer incomes rise and they consume more, it will lead to inflation. How do you address such concerns?
A - All this is part of attempts to create a fear psychosis. Look at the media today. One of the anchors was saying - there will be 20%, 25% inflation if MSP is legalized. I am thankful to him that he didn’t say 150% inflation. He could have said that also, because today we know what media is all about today.

The point I am trying to make is, there is no other way…Farmers have come to protest only because they are getting prices that are not even fit for a living income.

The national income of farmers, according to the latest situational assessment survey for agricultural households in 2019, tells us that the average income of a farming household – which may have people who may be running a shop, or involved in MNREGA – is only 10,218 rupees per month. That is at the bottom of the pyramid.

Today’s economy has been designed in such a way that it has really sacrificed agriculture for the sake of industry. This cannot go on: The nation must wake up and rescue the 50% of the population living in penury.

It is a difficult pathway, because we haven’t tried it earlier, but it’s completely possible. That’s the kind of reform India needs. What is wrong with 50% of India’s population also becoming economically prosperous? Why are we opposed to prosperity on the farm?

Q - A lot of people are asking why only farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh are protesting, when most of the current MSP procurement – almost entirely in the form of rice and wheat – is from these states.
A - Yes Punjab farmers already get MSP for their primary crops. But they are standing for the farmers from the rest of the country. They are saying, in Punjab and Haryana we get the MSP, but the rest of the country should also get the MSP. Another reason is that because they are in close proximity to New Delhi, they are the ones who can raise their voice there.

Q - Some feel that 50%, as suggested by the Swaminathan Commission, is too high a return for the farmers, and this will wreck the economy. How do you react to that?
A - Dr Swaminathan was a very distinguished agriculturist. He was the agriculture secretary of India at one time, he was with the planning commission at one time. He has been an internationally recognized scientist. The world listened to him. When he recommended C2+50%, do you think he was not aware what C2+50% would mean to the country’s economy? Why do all these bureaucrats sitting in the ministry of agriculture think they know better than Swaminathan?

Today, we are so much under pressure from corporates that we don’t even want to acknowledge the tremendous role played by Swaminathan in providing that formula that the country needs to adopt…if you can give him Bharat Ratna, you can also take up the formula he gave for the betterment of the masses. That will be the solution for ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’

Q - Lastly, there are also those who ask - Why should the government procure produce at a high price from Indian farmers when the same can be purchased from international markets at a lower price…
A - It is very sad that we have forgotten the ship-to-mouth existence India was living in one time not long ago. Food was coming directly from the ship to hungry mouths. We struggled so hard. Punjab farmers put up their entire effort to see the country become self-sufficient. Today, there’s complacency in the country, because we get food every night on our table, we don’t think it matters anymore. But we don’t realize that all those countries that did not become self-sufficient are facing lots of problems today.

It would be foolish if we think we can import food from abroad and achieve food security. Even a country like the US, the world’s greatest economy, puts in all kinds of protection measures to ensure they are not flooded with cheaper food from the rest of the world. If they can protect their food security, why, as a nation, are we ashamed to do that? I think this kind of thinking over the years has come because of the free market mantra.. But if we accept that, then we can also ask why we need industry in India, we can import stuff from outside. Let’s not forget the words of Dr Swaminathan – the future belongs to nations with grains, not guns.",-1,imgurliam,2024-02-17 18:46:35

Industrial revolution in Europe was funded by their colonies like Asia & Africa. Plus living conditions were at an all time low during the industrial revolution. Workers working for 16 hours, even women were working for 12 hours and kids were also expected to work despite having money from colonies.   


>Majority of tax is generated by them in these cities and all of that goes in subsidizing the lives of farmers and rural folk who don’t know what modern farming is, stubbornly refuse to listen to learned minds and are a perennial loss making venture, and default on all their loans only for the govt to waive it off, all at the expense of the TAXPAYER.

Green Revolution in India transformed the way we do farming around 1960. My uncle is a farmer he never got any of his loans waived off. All the money allocated to waive off goes into the pockets of the politicians and very little gets trickled down.

Especially for indian farmers as most of them don't have enough money to buy tractors as they don't own multiple acres of land. So many of them still rely on bulls & buffaloes. In my state the government is subsidizing small tractors which is nice it reduces the time needed for ploughing from 1 week to around 3 days. 

And current generation of farmers don't want to do farming they too want jobs. Farming is not an easy endeavour. 

It requires a lot of time, effort & even after that u r still at the mercy of nature. And somehow u get a good yield u don't get a good price for ur yield. Farming cannot sustain the livelihood of so many ppl. 

>Some idealistic middle class city dwellers call them “annadattas” and support them but they’re so brain dead cos they don’t realize that the failure of farmers to adopt modern farming is making their lives more expensive cos the govt has to extract the money from somewhere and it just so happens that the middle class is the most dependable cash cow.

Nehru wanted India to be self sustaining which is very important for a country like India. It is not an easy job to feed a population of 100+ Crore. We must appreciate our farmers they have a very tough life. 

Well the current regime has reduced corporate tax to an all time low. If we increase corporate tax, tax the rich we won't need to increase tax on the middle class.

>The politicians can’t do much no matter who it is, because they’ve to cater to 70% ignorant, uneducated people from the 17th century

U underestimate the rural citizens of india. They r as smart as us & some r even more smarter than us. I know ppl in my village who scored more than 90% in vernacular medium without classes while also helping in farming activities. I know kids who r in 12th grade but also earning money on the side despite lack of opportunities at my village.

>If you realize this one truth about India, you will pack your bags and make for greener pastures. Cos ain’t nobody got hundreds of years to wait for India to become developed.

India will never become a developed country. For a country to develop it's system (politicians, bureaucrats, society & ppl) must have a scientific attitude get rid of superstitions, religion, caste system, etc. Plus our politicians are scums. When scum rules the word, more scum is created.

See development can only happen in two ways. Either the people demand for it or the government forces it. Normally in a democracy, people are the ones who will demand. They will protest for change and constantly complain, make noise and put the government in their place when they make a mistake. This does not happen in India. People are very happy go lucky. They don’t care. The hunger here lies in areas such as religion. BJP saw this and took advantage of this. Now they’ve created an environment where if you complain against them, you’re anti national so as if it wasn’t bad enough that people didn’t complain about development, now the few who actually care to complain for change, will get arrested. That’s why BJP is a dangerous government. Neither is the BJP working towards development nor are they letting people talk about it.

----

Many things have changed in India since Narendra Modi first became prime minister. But one change that has gone almost unnoticed is that a process of real decolonisation has transpired. And because of this the old, colonised ruling class has been swept away. This is a very good thing. It should have happened long, long ago. As someone who belonged to that ruling class, I consider myself well qualified to explain why this process of decolonisation was overdue and how we failed India as its ruling class.

The truth is we were an effete, hopeless bunch. We spoke no Indian language well, but this did not matter to us. We were proud of speaking English well. In our drawing rooms we sneered at those who dared enter without speaking good English. And at those whose table manners were not embellished with western refinement. In short, those who fumbled with forks and knives and preferred eating with their hands and without cutlery.

When we travelled to foreign lands, we made a good pretense of being Indian, but we never cared to understand what it meant to be Indian. We pretended to know everything about India’s ancient culture and civilisation, but we knew almost nothing. In the schools and colleges we attended, we learned more about western civilisation, history, and literature than about our own, so it was not totally our fault.

When it came to politics and elections, we stuck loyally by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and its various heirs because they were people like us. We did not care that Parliament had been turned into a private members club. It was our club. Nor did we care that the Congress Party under Sonia Gandhi’s stewardship had also become a private club. It was our club. In our drawing rooms we talked endlessly of democracy and secularism and saw ourselves as ordained to protect these ideas.

Then along came Narendra Modi and the earth shifted beneath our feet. He may not have been personally responsible for everything that changed but he was a vital part of the political change that happened, and this somehow became an essential element of the bigger changes that were happening. Suddenly, almost overnight, after Modi first became prime minister, we became not just powerless but irrelevant. A new breed of Indians who spoke Hindi well and English not at all started replacing us in the high offices of government, as political analysts, and anchors in TV studios, in journalism, in Bollywood movies and TV series. They were not impressed with our skills in English, and we were so impressed by how Indian they were that we tried to emulate them just to belong. Some of us have succeeded, most of us have not.

Those who have not but wish to continue being relevant cling these days to Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi and hope that somehow, they will be able to defeat Modi. Some act as advisors to the current heirs of the Dynasty and fill their heads with grandiose ideas like saving the Constitution and saving democracy. But the truth is that Rahul Gandhi’s main message remains the same as it was in the last general election. This is that Modi is corrupt and that he works only for a handful of rich Indians. He steals your money, he shrieks at his political rallies, and he gives it to his rich friends. How exactly does this work?

As leader of the Congress Party, he is seen, especially by foreign correspondents, as the only man who can defeat Modi. It is bad luck for him that he seems so incapable of convincing Indian voters of this, despite trying hard to prove that he is one of them. He has worked with farmers in rice fields, transported coal on bicycles with miners, listened to the woes of vegetable sellers and spent long hours with mechanics in dingy shops to show how much he cares about the ‘common man.’ So why is the common man not impressed? Could it be because these gestures come across somehow as noblesse oblige and not genuine acts of sympathy?

What is it about ‘autocratic’, ‘dictatorial’ Modi that attracts ordinary Indian voters more? The answer that I got to this question on my recent travels in rural India is that people have seen changes in their lives, and they believe that these changes have happened because of Modi. These are not remarkable changes. They are simple things like roads, drinking water, electricity, and Internet services but because they were not there before, they seem remarkable.

Many of these things should have happened long ago. But because we were so colonised a ruling class, we did not notice that ordinary Indians were forced to endure the worst public services. In our drawing rooms and in our entitlement, we did not care about such things because in our privileged cocoon it would have been unthinkable to go to a government hospital or a government school. Modi’s advent burst the bubble in which we lived, and the truth is that most of us have no idea why this happened. We continue to hope that he will be defeated this time and hope that the message that democracy is in danger will resonate with voters. When the results come, we are likely to be disappointed again. I met nobody in rural India who saw Modi as corrupt and autocratic.",2,1-randomonium,2024-04-21 15:51:57

Tavleen Singh's interviews are interesting to say the least. She admits to have been a hardcore Modi ""bhakt"" until the moment her son(British-American journalist Aatish Taseer) had his Overseas Citizenship of India status taken away, purportedly for writing articles in international media that were critical of the Modi government.

But despite that she still maintains some of the same things she said before: That Modi's rise has been a rebellion against the traditional power elites of India, that the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty are not the answer, and that India's liberals need to acknowledge what is it that voters see in Modi that makes them support him.",1,1-randomonium,2024-04-21 15:51:57

As if this isn't bad enough, the farm gets divided among brothers through generations until the land is so small, they'll be reduced from farms to gardens in mere decades. Output of a farm doesn't scale linearly with size, so larger farms lead to (not exponentially, but) larger outputs.

As per the report available around fifteen people have been seriously injured in the repression. This is a brutal assault on bread earners from farmer families when they were protesting only for the implementation of the written promises made by the Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister and the Executive that failed to implement the agreement with SKM signed on 9th December 2021 are solely responsible for the present crisis and the causality.

The Platform of Central Trade Unions issued the following statement today 21st February 2024.

* Trade Unions strongly condemn the brutal killing of young farmer and injuries to dozens, 

* Declares to observe 23rd February as Black day all over India

The platform of Central Trade Unions express strong condemnation of the unprecedented and unprovoked force and oppression on the farmers at Khanauri and Shambhu borders by the Haryana police and Central forces today. One young life is lost, Shubhkaran Singh son of Charanjit Singh of Ballo village died of severe head injury and dozens of farmers have sustained injuries at Khanauri and Shambhu border. There have been use of cane charge, plastic bullets and tear gas shells on the farmers whose fault is that they wanted to reach the capital city of the country to demand from the government to fulfill the promises given to farmers at the time of taking back three farm laws based on which they lifted protest from Delhi borders.
While congratulating the workers and farmers for successful action on 16th February a joint call given by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM)  and the platform of Central Trade Unions, independent Federations/Associations for a  nationwide mass mobilisation alongwith Industrial/Sectoral Strike and Grameen Bharat Bandh, notes that this success of the movement has made the rulers in the centre nervous. The ruling regime in the centre and their party ruling in states are conspiring to use all means to crush any opposition and are inclined to use all kinds of unlawful actions.
We call upon the unions of all sectors organised and unorganized  to observe 23rd February as Black day and organise nationwide protests, wear black badges, have lunch hour protests, protest dharnas, processions, torchlight/candle light protests in whatever form they can express their anguish on the ruthless approach of Central Government towards workers and farmers of the country.
In the meanwhile we reiterate to continue the workers-farmers unity developed in course of time and would go in solidarity  action with any future  call by the SKM to fight back this anti-worker, anti-farmer, and anti-national government which is promoting corporate communal nexus.

As tourism of Ayodhya is definitely gonna rise in the following days ahead, more investments like apartments, residences, hotels, restaurants etc, have come up. Not sure about the amount of money invested coz different sources claim varying amounts of Investments, but the overall infra and economy will rise anyways.

About the ASI survey, there were found some buried pillars and other statues, which had inscriptions with Vedic and ancient kinds of carvings. It didn't clearly show any signs of existing ram mandir, but it was unobvious that it was related to Islam or Babur. So, it was concluded that it was Hindu or at least Indic in origin.

The hospitality industry might take some time, but it's definitely gonna get a boost. How much? I'm not sure about the numbers. 

Fate of Ayodhya-waasis however isn't gonna change overnight drastically. 

The money flows where you create wealth. 
Hospitality industries, eateries, stalls, restaurants, hotels etc are gonna get the big bucks. Even 10 years down the line, that's Marginal improvement in both taxes to the state govt and revenue generation. 

Make my trip, IRCTC, railways, Air India, Indigo, Vistara are the real beneficiaries!

Temple trust is the beneficiary. 

The people? Nope. 
Ayodhya won't suddenly become Ramnagari overnight and outperform Lucknow, Kanpur or Varanasi or Prayagraj, or Ghaziabad and Noida! Nope. If that had been the case, every temple town on India were prosperous or atleast the largest contributor to state exchequer! But that isn't the case is it? 
Tirupati isn't the crowned jewel of Andhra Pradesh! Neither is Amritsar to Punjab's economy! Neither is Shrdi or Nashik to Maharashtra's state economy! Rameshwaram, Kodaikanal, Madurai to TN, but no! 

Benefits are gonna accrue as they always do. But the magnitude which media is trying to peddle is sheer stupid! It's never as expected sadly. 
There are gonna be massive crowds, but the beneficiaries atleast the tangible ones apart from spiritual experiences of million adherents, are few! It's always has been the case. 

Travel agents and small business flourishing there are gonna be the real deal. And that too, if they happened to be Ayodhya-waasis! 
If outsider were to establish shops there, the people there aren't gonna get nothing!

*Cabinet Resolution on Pran Pratishtha at Shri Ram Temple, Ayodhya Dham Posted On: 24 JAN 2024 9:41 PM by PIB Delhi The Union Cabinet today passed a resolution on the Pran Pratishtha (consecration ceremony) of the Shri Ram Temple at Ayodhya Dham.*

*The text of the resolution is as follows:*

Prime Minister, first and foremost, all of us as members of your cabinet extend heartfelt congratulations to you on the consecration ceremony of the idol of Lord Ram.

The Indian civilization, which had been harbouring a dream for the past five centuries, has seen that ancient dream fulfilled through your efforts. Prime Minister, today’s Cabinet decision is historic. Historic events may have occurred several times, but an occasion like this, linking back to the time of the British and the establishment of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, has never happened before. This is unique because what happened through your efforts on 22nd January 2024, is unparalleled in history. It is unique because this opportunity has come after centuries. We can say that in 1947, the body of this nation became independent, and now, its soul has been consecrated. This has brought spiritual joy to everyone.

In your address, you mentioned that Lord Ram is not only an influence in India but also a flow, a principle, and destiny. Today, we can say from a spiritual perspective, rather than a political one, that destiny has chosen you for the consecration of Lord Ram, who is the epitome of the eternal flow and global influence of India.

Indeed, Lord Shri Ram is the destiny of India, and with destiny, a real union has now occurred. In reality, the consecration is not just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Cabinet members but can be considered a once-in-many-lifetimes opportunity.

We are all fortunate that on this occasion, we are all present in the Cabinet, the highest committee of the country. Prime Minister, through your actions, you have elevated the morale of the nation and strengthened cultural self-confidence.

The emotional outpouring we have witnessed across the country during the consecration is unprecedented. Although we saw unity among people during the Emergency as a form of popular movement, it was a resistance movement against authoritarianism.

The popular movement we witnessed for Lord Ram is ushering in a new era. People have waited for centuries, and today, with the consecration of Lord Ram in the grand Ram Temple, a new era has begun. Today, it has also created a new narrative for a movement.

Prime Minister, such a grand event can only be successful when there is the grace of the Lord on the doer. As Goswami Tulsidas Ji wrote, ‘Where there is grace of Ram, everyone receives grace.’

Prime Minister, the Ram Janmabhoomi movement was the only movement of independent India in which people from all over the country came together. It was associated with the anticipation and emotions of millions of Indians for years.

You observed an austerity of 11 days, and by meditating with a devotional attitude at the pilgrimage sites associated with Lord Shri Ram in India, you provided energy to the national unity of India. For this, we not only congratulate you as Cabinet members but also as ordinary citizens.

Honourable Prime Minister, the affection you have received from the public makes you a people’s leader, but now, after the advent of this new era, you have also emerged as a harbinger of a new age.

Your countless blessings, and may we all progress under your leadership in the future of India, for the progress of our country. Congratulations to you for creating a millennium cabinet today, or rather, a Cabinet of the Millennium, will not be an exaggeration.

For this reason, we all extend our congratulations to you and congratulate each other.

l76rq0o,1d8jwri,"Ever since yesterday's results came out, there's been a flood of hate towards the people of Ayodhya by b#@kts for not voting for the BJP. Apparently, building the Ram Mandir and bringing so called “development” should have guaranteed their loyalty. But here's the real story: the BJP sidelined the people of Ayodhya, wrecked their livelihoods, all for the sake of a temple. And as are we seeing now, even the temple was built only for the sake of votes.

This video and several articles from back in January laid it all out, and the BJP had plenty of time to fix things. But did they? Of course not. And now, suddenly, everyone is up in arms, calling the people of Ayodhya traitors, backstabbers, hijra’s and worse. Where was all this outrage when their lives were being torn apart?

The reason BJP lost is crystal clear - they ignored the people, and now they're paying the price.",67,Mayor_McCheese7,2024-06-05 07:16:02
l76q3f1,1d8jwri,"> While construction and painting are still ongoing in Ayodhya’s three main roads now known as the ‘Ram Path’, ‘Ram Janmabhoomi Path’ and ‘Bhakti Path’, an estimate of between 4,000 and 4,500 shops and homes reportedly have been broken down or displaced.

> But, despite a whopping Rs 30,000 crore being spent on this ‘new Ayodhya’, locals like Gupta are now paying the price of this development. Gupta, who built his three-storey residence in 1998, estimates the total value of his home and the land at “Rs 80 lakh”, but claims that authorities compensated him with a paltry Rs 9 lakh.

> A few shops down the same road in Niyawan is Satyaprakash Gupta’s small storefront. The 45 year old also owned a three-storey home, with the ground floor serving as his shop and workplace, but the home whose value he estimates at over Rs 40 lakh was compensated with just Rs 9 lakh. Even as he used the compensation amount to rebuild his shop, he now lives on rent with his wife and three children, owing to the inability to rebuild the upper floors that once used to be the family’s residence.

An early form of what we now call Hinduism, including an early form of Sanskrit, came to India via migration from Central Asia. 

Buddhism, having originated in Bihar, had its places of worship destroyed by Hindu kings and turned into temples. Badrinath for example in Uttarakhand was built after destroying a Buddhist monastery. I don't see you rallying for that anytime soon.",0,icedlong,2024-01-24 00:59:50

kjaz5nt,19e4dxs,"You just jumped several logical hoops there immersed as you were in devotion to Lord Ram. First, Babur himself in his chronicles never recorded  destroying a temple in Ayodhya and is known to have come only 15 km closest to this area.

Archaeological evidence was so weak for a temple beneath the masjid that even the Gogoi led bench had to set it aside andappeal to some twisted logic to award the land to the Hindus. If you follow the history of the dispute you will see that at first a portion in one corner was considered the birthplace that slowly advanced to being right under the dome. So clearly no one knew for sure.

Also this whole mischief started with the British in 1858 who clearly saw a path into Awadh province by dividing its population. So congratulations for championing the idea you should be knighted by the King pretty soon.",0,kyunahi,2024-01-24 00:59:50

kpsuor3,1anhaxj,"Then Swamiji (Swami Vivekananda) said that on the way back he returned to Srinagar by the common route by which the pilgrims return. 

A few days after returning to Srinagar, he went to visit Kshir Bhavani Devi and staying there for seven days worshipped the Devi and made Homa to her with offerings of Kshira (condensed milk). Every day he used to worship the Devi with a maund of Kshira as offering. 

One day, while worshipping, the thought arose in Swamiji's mind: ""Mother Bhavani has been manifesting Her Presence here for untold years. The Mohammedans came and destroyed her temple, yet the people of the place did nothing to protect Her. Alas, if I were then living I could never have borne it silently."" 

When, thinking in this strain, his mind was much oppressed with sorrow and anguish, he distinctly heard the voice of the Mother saying, ""It was according to My desire that the Mohammedans destroyed this temple. It is My desire that I should live in a dilapidated temple, otherwise, can I not immediately erect a seven - storeyed temple of gold here if I like? What can you do? Shall I protect you or shall you protect me!"" 

Swamiji said, ""Since hearing that divine voice, I cherish no more plans. The idea of building Maths etc. I have given up; as Mother wills, so it will be.""

The Gandhi family also lost their hold on amethi. In any other scenario, the political party would have tried to bring on a new face.

Assamese religion is different from BJP's hindutva. Assamese Hindus eat beef and worship different Gods like Kamakhya. They also visit churches.

Hindutva politics is not going to work there but BJP government is in power so they are trying everything they could to make it next Manipur. Pitting bodos and karbis against Assamese.

kh6riyq,1934q75,"The Yatra will begin from Manipur on January 14, travelling 6200 km across 14 states, to reach Mumbai on March 20. The Yatra, which will focus on the issues of unemployment and inflation, as well as social and economic justice, comes at the crucial moment ahead of the 2024 General Election.

The BJP intends to fight the 2024 election on the issue of Ram Mandir. The party is trying to use its communal agenda to influence the voters in North India. Congress' Bharat Nyay Yatra can provide an effective counter to BJPs communal agenda in this region.

North India has a large youth population suffering from massive unemployment. The youth are disillusioned and angered by the policies of the Modi Government. Their ire turned into arson when the agitators targeted the BJP offices during Agnipath protests. The recent security incident in Parliament is another reminder of the crisis unfolding in India.

Congress' Bharat Nyay Yatra is a brilliant move that can change the narrative of the 2024 General Election. The experience of Bharat Jodo Yatra shows that such a movement can help bring the issues of the common people into popular discourse. Even the mainstream media is unable to ignore such a movement. Bharat Jodo Yatra received overwhelming support from the common people, and stands as a testimony to the fact that BJP's narrative can be successfully countered. Bharat Nyay Yatra is a commendable movement that must be wholeheartedly supported.

A govt committee was setup to double the farmers income in 2016. It estimated that indian farmers annual income was Rs 96,703 in 2015-’16. The committee set the targeted double income at Rs 192,694 by 2023.

While data for 2022-’23 is not available, according to the last situational survey data released in 2021, the average annual income of farming households increased from Rs 96,703 in 2015-’16 to Rs 1,22,616 in 2018-’19.

So in two years, there was a jump of Rs 25,000, which was inline with the estimates.

Because of covid, I do suspect that there might be a slight downtrend in those years. 

Then the article curiously quotes the below line, totally out of context and nothing to do with the headline. 

""This suggests the annual growth in farmers’ income has been mere 2.8% – less than over 3% growth between 2002-’03 and 2012-’13, the decade that roughly corresponds to the tenure of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government.""

Nothing in the scroll document you listed had anything showing conclusively that the income has not doubled. And MSP growth slowing down is an absolutely good thing which we want. This means that farming inflation is low and prices are stable which is what is needed for an economy and society like India where agriculture and food security plays an important part. If MSP is increasing at a rapid price, that indicated major food insecurity and inflation.",-7,sri_peeta,2024-02-16 12:53:52

This is the only line which is within the context, drooling over some 25k difference between the incomes is actually out of context!

The onus of proof lies within the person who made the claim, that ""farmers income has doubled""!

Many of them sound like the kind of answers Miss World contestants give: nobody can disagree with most of them and many are indeed good things to have - but there doesn't seem to be any substantial idea of how to get there. 


> Reform in collegium system, establishing a court of appeals, promoting diversity in judiciary.

Good idea, but the courts have opposed this and will continue to do so. [They've struck down attempts to do this as unconstitutional](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sc-dismisses-plea-seeking-review-of-2015-verdict-striking-down-njac-act/articleshow/66897177.cms?from=mdr). Given that they have the freedom to interpret what ""Basic structure"" means, and that any reform will result in the govt getting more power in terms of appointments and thus reduce the judiciary's power, any future attempts will have the same result. 


> Reform in personal laws.

Are all religions are included in this? How is this compatible with the INC position on UCC? What if a religion (read: its fundamentalist demagogues) oppose this, will they get a veto? Or will the govt have the political will to bite the bullet and ram through the reform in the face of opposition from the fundamentalists? Specifically: will an *INC-led coalition govt* have the political will to push this through?


> Recognising civil unions for same-sex marriage.

Good idea (in fact I'd love for them to go all the way and recognize them as actual marriages) but again, do the religious fundamentalists get a veto? If some religions oppose this, will an INC led govt let go of this? [In the past they have been confused over the issue](https://theprint.in/opinion/section-377-exposes-bjp-and-congress-doublespeak-on-homosexuality/81783/). Again: will an *INC-led coalition govt* have the political will to push this through?


> Strengthening Parliamentary System.

What exactly does that mean? Will the Anti Defection Law be repealed? This is the single biggest structural contributor towards the decimation of the Parliamentary System. When your MP/MLA is legally required to vote as per the diktats of the party, they effectively become puppets of the leadership. Parliament/Assemblies are reduced to irrelevance because you could literally replace them with an Excel sheet that multiplies the number of MPs/MLAs each party has with the vote that the party boss wants them to cast. There is no scope for the MP/MLA to vote in the best interests of her constituency. This in turn creates this quasi-Presidential type of election, because it is ultimately the party boss who calls all the shots. I doubt the INC will repeal it, because this also weakens the leadership (while empowering the rank and file) of their own party and allies. This is also why the BJP will also not repeal it. 


> Multi-modal urban public transport. 

Excellent idea, but pushing this from the centre is a deeply flawed approach. Even pushing it down from the state govt level is problematic; the right solution has to be to empower civic bodies by decentralising power, giving them revenue generation capabilities and making them accountable to citizens of the city. This enables each city to produce a system that works for its unique needs - the constraints and needs of Mumbai are very different from those of Bangalore. Again, nobody wants to do this kind of decentralisation because it reduces the power of the centre and state govts - and the INC manifesto suggests they too want to go in the opposite direction.",35,rsa1,2024-04-13 07:48:28

(actionable steps at bottom)  
I think I agree that India has not even touched upon the massive power it can achieve as a country.I want it to achieve it,but it is a task which requires sacrifice.

Btw,i'm obsessed about ideas like these so thats how I found this article.

As Margaret Mead said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.” A determined group of political entrepreneurs can ignite their passion for change, channelise their anger against politicians and their parties,  leverage the power of digital technology, and create a movement that can form a government which, for the first time, will put Indians on an irreversible path to freedom and prosperity. This is the revolution India needs.

I'd love to be a part of such a movement!I only want to be in touch with some like minded individuals thats all. Let's create a group or something.

l0y53nb,1cb6n9s,"Here's my list of concrete steps. 

1. Government housing for any citizen in India who needs it. They should charge rent but way below market prices so housing is not a private market extortion racket like it is right now. 

2. Ration is available to everyone irrespective of their 
wealth status. Everyone needs basic food. 

3. Construction reforms. Establish a grid system in cities. The type of neighbourhood highly affects people's mentality. We need religion neutral neighbourhoods, so no new Masjids, temples or gurdwaras, with wide roads so everyone gets sunlight. And limit the height to 10 floors. Again sunlight. Make all the cables underground in cities, wider mandatory footpath in every single road. Underground metros. Not the overground nonsense they've built with a short term vision to win the election. 

4. Transportation reforms. Need more seater coaches in trains. And big windows. With the same ticket prices.

5. Law reforms. If we copy American laws word to word the country will be better off by miles even with the gun laws. But we can't, so the next best thing is to get rid of sedition, UAPA, PMLA etc. And many other laws like kissing in public is not legal and all the other crap like marital rape. I don't think BR Ambedkar made good laws.

6. Institutional reforms. Government censor boards should be abolished. Absolute freedom speech including hate speech, because the only thing achieved by these censor laws is allowing the government to clamp down speech. There's no solution for hate speech and misinformation except defeating it with anti hate speech and fact checking. Police should be allowed to work independently without interference from politicians. And the chief of police should also be elected by the police themselves as the top rots a lot

7. Continue Digitalisation. One thing Modi was right about is digitising reduces corruption. Kejriwal too. And we should continue and cut bureaucracy wherever possible. 

8. Controversial but Remove reservations. These are creating more divisions than harmony. They have failed in their purpose clearly and there's no improvement to show off. All this does is increase corruption, bureaucracy and more people wanting assured seats. These reinforce c Punishing the sons for their father's crime doesn't make sense. Blanket economic reservations should be the way.  

9. Invest in renewables like crazy. When we have excess energy we can surely think of ways to utilize it. But we need the energy now. 

10. Fines as a percentage of income of a business / person, otherwise it is only a deterrent for the poor.",2,Smash-my-ding-dong,2024-04-23 14:53:28

* figure out a way we can instill basic values of civic sense/consent/cleanliness amongst our people. its a tough uphill battle, but we aren't the only third world countries and other countries have been able to deal with this
* we need such massive and sweeping police reforms, its hard to think where to begin lol. from lack of training, lack of enforcement, rampant corruption, straight up apathy and incompetence to massive under policing in some areas
* find some kind of solution to the illegal encroachment of people from outside and establish some form of border security. its not bigoted to say we need to have these things. not only are we a poor and resource strapped country who cant take care of our own, its also a unbelievable security risk
* we need to find a solution to the issue of unemployment amongst educated youth as fast as possible otherwise it would lead to unimaginable consequences. the onus falls on the private sector to create the jobs. our lack of emphasis on manufacturing early on will haunt us forever, and it might actually be too late to fix things.
*  its a combination of low quality graduates that are being churned out by universities that done equip them with the necessary tools to become effective at their work. the reputation of Indian higher education is in the pits.

Only then we rise above this will we, as a country, care about issues that really matter. And once we show this will our politicians actually be incentivised to focus on things that actually improve the lives of the people of this country. 

I'll give you an example, Delhi the air is unbreathable at the moment. Yet people celebrate Diwali with fireworks and lodhi with open fires. Now, while I agree the actual amount of pollution added to the air compared to everything else is negligible. But this is a matter of showing intent and showing what is important to you, this clearly shows you value religious ceremonies more than breathable air, because remember nothing stops you from doing your prayers and celebrating these festivals without fireworks and open fires.

To reach where China is today, which has a per capita GDP of 12.7k USD, at the same rate it will take 24 years.

People are convenient to mix their wastes into one bin than to segregate it into biodegradable and non biodegradable wastes.

People don't follow traffic rules cause not only of the urgency of their workplace, but also it's convenient to break traffic rules and get to a destination quick rather than having a steady and safe travel. It's convenient to overcrowd a bus or train to the point of even hanging out by a death strand, rather than to wait for next possible shift of the transport. Even in bribery, it's convenient to bribe someone and get the task done quick/sneaky than to be honest on doing the task on earnest ways. Its convenient to buy a cheap knockoff of a product than to research deep into things and buy a reliable one.

US basically latched onto protests in Egypt's Tahrir Square and used those as a pretext for toppling multiple Arab regimes. Naturally, US was never going to allow Tahrir Square protests to take Egypt away from America's control, because US control over populous Egypt is a lynchpin for Israel's security. (Similarly, America will never stop sending bombs to Israel while it drops them on Gaza children to kill them, because Israel will always be Washington's top consideration)

l4h6776,1cu5ti3,"While everyone here seems to be busy in talking about the allegations and the video recording that came out, good but not sufficient

Here is what most people arent talking about and some more questions that people need to ask AAP :

1.	⁠The allegations are not on Kejriwal himself, but his PA..so why does he dodge the question when asked yesterday in press conference?
2.	⁠If he believes that Swati Maliwal’s allegations are true even to a remote extent, He can simply say, we are suspending the PA until outcome of investigation and allowing the police to investigate.
3.	⁠If he believes that they are fabricated and a conspiracy by BJP to tarnish AAP, then why isn’t AAP coming forward and releasing the CCTV footage themselves to clear the air?

Wont that actually prove they are not the same as BJP. Will actually prove they stand for transparency and women’s safety rather than just talk about these issues only when accused is from their political rivals.

Rest everything is just trying to spin a narrative both from supporters of AAP/INDIA alliance and supporters of BJP

•	⁠Its been noticed that she isnt active after she took oath as RS member and she hasnt actively participated in protests staged against the arrest of Kejriwal, she isnt seen anywhere, neither in PCs or otherwise
•	⁠She being DCW chief , knows the rules and protocols to follow when such incidents occur,

The allegations in the FIR are damning, wonder why she visited the Police station on the first day but returned without filing a complaint, because there is no way such allegations can be compromised upon between AAP , accused and the victim.

•	⁠For 2-3 days she does not give any statement/makes no appearance, then goes for a medical checkup.

So these are some points people are talking to say she has staged it, maybe maybe not who knows but notice how none of them actually pertain to the “alleged assault”.

Maybe she has had a fallout with AAP after being nominated as RS member, but that doesn’t mean she can be abused. She not giving a police complaint on the first day has nothing to do with the actual “assault” that may or may not have happened.

An assault might have actually happened and she visited police station but had pressure on her to withdraw her case or whatever

She going to AIIMS after a delay, the delay has nothing to do with the actual alleged assault.

All these are logical fallacies, none of these affect or prove or disprove the actual alleged assault.

Both sides seem fishy, but the benefit of the doubt should be given to the victims in such cases and the case has to be investigated thoroughly. Supporters of AAP just cant do usual whataboutery the way BJP does by saying “why dint she file a case on first day, why dint she go to aiims on the first day?, and making allegations that BJP has a hand behind this etc etc” , makes AAP look so cheap

In politics allegations themselves are portrayed and assumed as truth by their opponents. Just naming Arvind Kejriwal in Liquor case as accused was enough for BJP to declare AAP and him as corrupt and guilty.

And at that time when allegations were on AAP, AAP did press conferences everyday showing how BJP got electoral bonds from the south liquor lobby and showing other evidence etc

AAP should do the same here with full transparency and integrity. When it comes to politics, accusations have to be defended tooth and nail as well,  not just left to be proven by the person making allegations because they will definitely be milked for political mileage.

Swati Maliwal in her recent tweet stated that let CCTV footage come out, truth will be out.

So AAP should release and make it transparent and clear all the air and fishiness. Their silence is awful. AAP cannot stay silent while elections are going to happen next week, we all know how GODI media and BJP machinery will milk this issue till the election where perception matters.

It's hard to believe anyone can step inside the CMs residence without security's vigilance. And that BJP personally orchestrated this grand plan of inciting a physical assault.

By theoretically accepting that this kind of public psychology exists (and I will concede that it does) doesn't it run the risk of presuming that there is a ""cleaner"" alternative somewhere on the leftist political spectrum. Isn't your own position then quite similar to the one you're analyzing? I personally don't think that lesser evilism can be defeated because the very notion of defeating it posits that a ""better"" alternative exists elsewhere, that is radical politics when in fact all parties have to somewhere down the line tread the tightrope of pragmatism and take decisions which will be divisive. There rarely ever is a decision made for the people that won't elicit divisive opinions so there will always be such gradations of good or evil by which even radicals would be falling into the same discourse of sanctity whereas in politics there's rarely ever room for such utopic ideals.

Depending on where you're searching from you'll get more material. 

I think the concept of looking behind the obvious is important even though they might appear unimportant. As far as the freemason and the Bildenberg go, its not about just playing a big or small role. The imperial core has had time to develop layers and layers of systems and symbolism - some conspicuous and most not. The point is to not dismiss the those supposedly small elements just because they are not loudly discussed and are not the most immediate causal factors. Even though you might not know what exactly is happening, you need to be real and keep your eyes open. I learnt this from the Black Panthers (and continue to learn this from my fellow Black comrades) whose very real need for survival within a directly violent system meant that nothing was insignificant. And theory was not always right - the term ""stay woke"" was coined by Black ppl as a way to say ""Keep your eyes open!"" , and was later coopted by liberals and used by the right wing to delegitimize the whole thing.
Take Greta Thunberg for instance. [So many African leaders spoke about the need for climate and sustainability before her. ](https://thewire.in/environment/greta-thunberg-climate-strike-morningstar-capitalism-white-male-saviour#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=17071985643172&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fthewire.in%2Fenvironment%2Fgreta-thunberg-climate-strike-morningstar-capitalism-white-male-saviour) but for some reason she suddenly becomes a climate influencer. And you actually have so, so many pictures of her doing the freemason one eyed thing. It's so common that you can just search for this and it will pop up. You can argue about the utility of what it does, but symbology itself is a very very tightly controlled and intentional within the imperial core - something we dismiss because we just can't grasp why someone would put that amount of effort into continuity of symbols? But we forget that money is not a motive here. It's hard to Understand that as people living in  a society where artificial scarcity is maintained even at an economic loss and competition drives everything. What would you do if you had generational wealth for centuries with no regard to money, at all? What would you put your time in? We should use the theory we have been given by Lenin, Marx, Stalin, Mao but we cannot presume that the imperialists just stopped evolving and creating ever intricate structures of control.",1,nakshanayak,2024-02-06 00:05:41

l6i6s98,1d4ah8g,"Just a few thoughts. Not a CPIM supporter. The left movement in Kerala made many gains for dalits (which is why it has traditionally been the party they rallied around) and especially ezhavas and landless Christians (few syrians, latin Catholics, nadars), the lower class nairs. Land reforms did help a lot of middle castes to rise up. Those land and other social reforms were rooted in the movements of the marginalized castes and working classes. You can just compare the situation of dalits in Kerala versus Tamil Nadu or for that matter the North. In Tamil Nadu, while they have their own identity based parties, the caste violence under Dravidian party politics has been bloody. In Kerala, on the other hand, class based parameters for dalits (education, internet penetration, income) tend to be higher than the rest of India but due to lack of their own politics, their interests have been put behind by the upper and middle castes. That being said Inter-marriage among caste groups is highest in Kerala among Indian states (around 10-20%). Of course, Kerala is still a casteist misogynist reactionary society but we can compare Arguably the caste system in Kerala was among the worst in the subcontinent. Teltumbde mentions how it was worse than in Bengal. So the left movement from P Krishna Pillai to others did work even along caste lines but only at the surface level. You can read KK Shailajas memoir and the various struggles of the left movement. So the current gains made by Kerala are the results of the overall left movement including militant revolutionaries, dalits, etc. should not just be seen as CPIM. One of my wife's uncles has been a lifelong ambedkarite, supporter of Mayawati/BSP in the past, is today funnily a Pinarayi stan. However, the current social democratic setup cant sustain these gains for long and the cpm being an oppressive many a times reactionary party whenever it comes into power, it needs to be replaced by a militant left movement.  But it doesn't matter what party comes into power, under the current Indian state they can only make so many gains. So the left movement needs to seen holistically but radical left is the way forward.",14,Ok-Parsnip-3641,2024-05-30 18:13:43

Kerala   

Aren't the WB and Kerala wings quite different?   

The first Kerala govt that tried to bring in land reforms and reform the education sector was dissolved.    

> Even today, the first dalit leader in the politburo of the party was only admitted in 2022, 58 years after it’s creation, how utterly shameful.   

In a way, indeed shameful. But token positions are not effective too.   

> Caste census   

It's likely going to be used by everyone else to polarise Kerala along caste and religious lines. Delicate issue for the left to handle, especially with growing Hindutva. It should be done by the centre, for the whole of the country.   


> I hope by this article I am able to convince you, the reader ,why as leftists we shouldn’t support the CPI(M).   

Who should be supported then? Or is there no one to be supported?    

I think the Kerala C P I M needs to be supported. Furthermore, good leftists need to engage with them and improve them.    

If there is no better option to support, then who benefits from the withdrawal of support?   
The likely outcome is that a party that is more reactionary will gain power.

Hamas is at the centre of the freedom struggle and they have the support of the leftist liberation groups as well. Just because they’re not communist doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be supported. They are fighting western imperialism

However it wasn’t. But that doesn’t mean the bourgeois revolution was a bad thing. It was still a fight against imperialism

Also, on ""brain drain"" it is not what the word implies, that some ""exceptional"" people leave india and it hurts development or whatever, it is simply that quality education and even basic education remains inaccessible for a big part of the country. Additionally education is primarily designed to produce easily employable wage slaves, hence only the rich are able to become ""exceptional"". 

And due to the comprador nature of india, even those who dont leave are primarily contributing to the imperialist appropriation of labour and goods.

Dear Comrades, As we commemorate International Women's Day, it's imperative for us, as members of the Indian left movement, to reflect on the struggles, achievements, and ongoing challenges faced by our women in our society. In India, women have historically been at the forefront of numerous progressive movements, from fighting against colonial oppression to advocating for labor rights and social justice. Yet, despite their invaluable contributions, they continue to face multifaceted forms of discrimination and marginalization. The Indian left has always recognized the inherent intersectionality of women's struggles, understanding that gender oppression cannot be divorced from other forms of exploitation and inequality, such as class, caste, and religion. This intersectional approach is crucial in addressing the diverse needs and experiences of women across different socio-economic backgrounds.

We reaffirm our commitment to feminist principles and the empowerment of women in all spheres of life. This means actively challenging patriarchal structures within our own organizations and communities, amplifying the voices of marginalized women, and advocating for policies that promote gender equality and social justice. We recognize the indispensable role of women in the ongoing struggles for land rights, labor rights, environmental justice, and against communalism and fascism. Women are not just victims of oppression; they are agents of change, leading grassroots movements and shaping the future of our society. As we celebrate the achievements of women past and present, let us also acknowledge the work that still lies ahead. We must continue to fight against gender-based violence, ensure equal access to education and healthcare, and strive for economic empowerment and political representation for all women.

kh1zyx4,1908lio,"CPI + CPI(M) + RSP + AIFB + CPI(ML)M should merge together to form the *new* Left Party with the name of CPI and Symbol ☭ of CPI(M).
The United CPI☭ should form alliances with similar welfarism/cadre-based/non-nepotistic parties like AAP. Also AAP will help The United CPI☭ to regain some of its lost ground from the Hindi-Belt.

Forming a new party will not do much as there is no void for a new socialist national party, there are already 4 big national parties of every ideology (except NPP).
Centrist/Composite Nationalist- INC
Centre-Right/Communalism/Ultra-Nationalism- BJP
Left/Communist/Federalism- CPI(M)
Centre-Left/Welfarism/Federalism- AAP

There is some space for a Secular Right/Centre-Right/Centrist Liberal Party (like the Swatantra party or Swabhimani Paksha or Lok Satta Party) which will cut into BJP's vote bank and make the politics more equal and diverse.",5,None,2024-01-06 19:59:07
kh38r4z,1908lio,"The centre right may cut its vote share but alliances exist and it would probably be more aligned with the bjp. Reasons may include economic liberalism cuz why not profit over people in their piranha eyes and the Congress party is weak and the fact that regional parties more focused on staying on to state power rather than expanding as their more focused on regionalism rather than creating a new national movement. 
The current first past the post system doesn't help the situation but also at the same time is an opportunity for new national left wing movement. With the current electoral system we're seeing less political parties and now a united states style republican democratic war which will badly affect us. Sure there is the india alliance but they only have one goal and that is to beat modi(which they won't) and the alliance will probably dissolve after the election but it is an opportunity for a national party that is left wing but modern, has a clear message for the people and is more focused on policies rather that name calling some random ass mp or mla for who they are or what they look like but most important of all, a fighting force against the bjp before the slow demise of india going into the dark ages of corporate greed and bjp forming a supermajority in the lok sabha. Sure the communist party can create a left bloc with other parties with similar ideas but I feel like most people but not all are disillusioned by communism and its perceived nature and the fact that media are a bunch of  bjp cocksuckers will demonize the alliance. A more democratic socialist idea may be better as I bet hardly other than 10 people in this fucking country doesn't know what that is and I won't judge all of you for being Marxist Leninists or maoists ok but please do the same for me you are the only left wing indian political and I prefer not to be banned or anything like that.

2. I mean another centre-right party will probably form an alliance with the BJP BUT it would revive the NDA and provide a space for dissent in the NDA which is presently almost absent, also it would  erase the footprints of Communal organizations like the RSS, Bajrang Dal in some areas
3. Alliance Partners do keep BJP in check as long as they are together because BJP became Anti-Sikh just after the (Sikh party) Shiromani Akali Dal i.e. SAD left NDA in 2020 due to farm laws, the erstwhile SAD-BJP alliance restored the Hindu-Sikh brotherhood in Punjab after years of Sikh Militancy, targeted Hindu killings, anti-sikh riots etc. There is a reason that why BJP didn't implemented CAA-NRC and UCC right away because BJP's North East Allies protested.
