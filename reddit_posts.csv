Vote only for employment nothing else mattes in 2024,"Election is near and so are unnecessary mention of Pakistan every other post. Lets not get diverted and focus on making gov accountable for unemployment, future of unemployment with advancements in AI (private school teachers, most graduation courses, IT Engg) we are all on the verge of getting royally screwed. It doesn't matte if child in India utters AI after being born, that shit wont get him job or a stable future .

Unemployment will be the next corona we have to ensure, our ministers might not get new fortuner, crysta fleet this year but lets demand some concrete policies be it to force companies to give jobs or some compensation for laying off people like pigs. Universal basic income or some compensation. Relief in income tax

Since ""humari seema me naio koi ghusa hai"" lets cut money on buying weapons, Whats the point of protecting a county where 80% youths are unemployed or unemployable.

Vote for employment, its gonna be the next pandemic. US recession has been going for last 2year with not sign of stopping. We need our gov to step in and find ways to increase hiring across all sectors.

With unemployment crime rates are increasing in cities and it gonna get worse. Medical expenses /education expenses/ rent / property prices are through the roof and needs some check and balances.

Ignore all pakistan this and pakistan that (F\*\*K PAKISTAN) and make employment a issue

1c28s17,India,Lok Sabha election 2024,"Guys do not lose hope. Ignore 400 paar, I do not think BJP's win is that easy. ","First of all we need a wake up call from this media/social media narrative. These narratives are in BJP's control since Media is with them and they have significant IT Cell backing.

BJP had 303 seats in 2019 Lok Sabha seats. To get to their target they have to retain all these seats and gain 67. Which is quite difficult even impossible. DON'T BELIEVE THE MEDIA'S NARRATIVE. 


1) Unemployment is a big issue. Not everyone is going to vote for it - Yes. Some people might even ignore it but people who are facing these issues themselves, their family is not going to vote for them. It'll reduce their vote share.
2) Farmers have been hurling stones at the BJP Party. They have no credibility left with farmers. Not all farmers but a major percentage. Their families will not be voting for BJP in this elections (and some people just never). Haryana and Punjab being important states.
3) 2019 had a significant increase from 2014 seats because of Jio's free internet, Pulwama attack etc. Today, it's about Mandir which has faded a little bit already. 
4) BJP's image is not as clean as 2019. There were no big issues raised. Today their image has fallen. They are desperate. Today people are saying they are less corrupted. 
5) Democracy dying is a big narrative that is there. Some people may dismiss it but they know it already. 
6) Alliance also mean that oppositions vote share will be one. They are more likely to gain the number of vote share fighting as one.
7) Nitish Kumar's image in Bihar has fallen down. People have started hating him a little. BJP is much likely to lose seats there. 
8) Karnataka where they performed really well but recently lost in state elections, are they going to perform and retian the same number of seats - 25/28?
9) Covid second wave being one of the biggest failures of the government. Has it not lost some amount of credibility there? 

All I'm saying is let's not get sucked into the narrative that it's definitely a win. We should be okay with being wrong rather than just giving up.

It's time we spread the counter-narrative through our social media accounts and start questioning the narrative. Let's call bullshit on BJP. Their fake promises of growth and how corrupted they are. There are around 900 million voters. If you meet one person one second from this point on then it'll take you 28 years to meet everyone. So no survey, no opinion can tell you the truth. 

So don't give up hope.

19dg088,India,Lok Sabha election 2024,To the PM of this country - a question.,"Over many centuries across the world, thousands of religious monuments must have been destroyed only for something else to be erected in it’s place - typically a structure belonging to the religion of the person / group of people involved in its destruction. 

However, these were different times. These were times when religion held great sway over people - right down from their lifestyle to what they ate to where they lived to their importance in society - everything was dictated by religion. 

These were not modern times, these were not civilised societies. 

But this is now. This is 2024. Does religion still control everything? Are our lives and our standing in society supposed to be governed entirely by religion? If not, then why is the Prime Minister of a nation so intent in trying to settle scores with a historical ruler from 500 years ago? 

As PM, is he not responsible for the entire country and all citizens since the time of it being handed over to you? Even if Babur destroyed a Hindu temple to build a mosque - that mosque too has existed for over 500 years now. Was it not part of India? 

Histories of countries are messy, complicated affairs. But that does not mean you start undoing every little thing that displeases you today about your past. Will you start destroying every mosque that has ever been built on once disputed territory?

The Mughals were not plunderers and looters like Timur and so many others - who took what they needed and left india. The Mughals lived and ruled this land for over 350 years! They played a great role in uniting large parts of south asia into what we call India today. Trying to undo their influence, ‘righting their wrongs’ as you see it - is actually trying to undo the very history of India. 

For arguments sake, if someone starts a rumour or if you find some kind of archaeological evidence of the Taj Mahal being built over the ruins of a previous Hindu structure - will you bring it down too?",907,0.63,538,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/19dg088/to_the_pm_of_this_country_a_question/,Not_wun_wun,2024-01-23 04:29:13

1cvkcv7,India,Lok Sabha election 2024,Thinking about next 5 years if BJP wins is scary and horrifying. ,"
Some of the promises they have made in their manifesto seem like the final blow and nail in the coffin to Indian Democracy.

**1. One nation one election, under the garb of saving costs will deal a deathly blow to our Democracy which is already in ICU.**

>1. Dilution of Regional Issues: State elections often focus on specific regional concerns, and combining them with national elections could overshadow these crucial matters

>2. Reduced Accountability: Longer election cycles may reduce the frequency at which voters can hold governments accountable for their actions, potentially leading to complacency among elected representatives

>>>*1. When elections are staggered and spread across, it atleast keeps the national/multi-state parties on their toes and keeps them somewhat accountable and also allows for other states’ issues/national issues to affect state elections.*

>>>2.*For example : Say a massive farmers protest occurs in Delhi and their ill treatment might influence voting decision of farmers in local states that are going to elections in the following months or a big corruption scandal that got exposed nationally might affect the same party’s prospects in the local elections.*

>>3. The constitutional challenges of ""One Nation One Election"" intensify if a government is dissolved or dismissed prematurely. This scenario raises complex issues regarding synchronizing the terms of the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, requiring amendments to Articles 83, 85, 172, 174, and 356 of the Constitution. The need to manage breaks due to dissolution, President's Rule, or hung assemblies poses significant hurdles, potentially undermining India's federal structure. Without proper synchronization and constitutional amendments, the proposal risks facing legal and structural criticisms, impacting the democratic fabric of the country.

2.**UCC**

>1. UCC and Some sections of the new criminal laws are outright anti people and snatch away our freedoms. Like UCC requiring live in relationships registration and requiring scrutiny/consent from a police station guy, maintaining registry, and then after breakup
 
>>2. **Anti-Woman and Anti-Democratic (Anti-Liberty and State interference in personal lives):** The UCC is seen as anti-woman, anti-democratic, and draconian. It restricts adult women's sexual autonomy, allows for moral policing, and interferes in consensual relationships, including marriage and divorce

>3.**Criminalization and Penalties**: The UCC is criticized for its heavy focus on penalties and punishment, creating a legal environment that criminalizes personal choices and relationships.

>4 **Exclusion of Tribes and Targeting Minorities**: Critics highlight the exclusion of Scheduled Tribes (STs) from the UCC and its perceived targeting of Muslims. The law is viewed as a ""Hindu Code"" that imposes cultural values on all citizens, especially minorities

> 5.**Registration of Live-In Relationships**: Mandatory registration of live-in relationships is seen as intrusive, violating individual autonomy, and potentially leading to marital disputes, interference from authorities, and societal scrutiny

>6. **Selective Application and Double Standards:** Critics argue that the UCC's selective application, exemptions for certain communities, and exclusion of tribal and minority groups undermine the law's claim to uniformity and equality

>7. These criticisms collectively paint a picture of a UCC in Uttarakhand that is perceived as regressive, discriminatory, and detrimental to personal freedoms, especially in the context of relationships and breakups.

**And then if BJP wins this time with almost similar results as 2019 and in worst case if it gains more seats, then it reinforces BJP’s mindset , attitude and gives them bold confidence that what they are doing does not matter to people**

3. Manipur does not matter. They can get away with gross incompetence.
   
>1. *In any half decent democracy, this alone would be enough for a president’s rule to be enforced and state govt dismissed and army brought in.*

4.**Protests mean nothing to this govt and are dealt with force.**

>*1. Farmers protest took over a year with 700+ deaths and we all saw how the recent farmer protests were treated almost as an infiltration into the country with nails,spikes, blockages etc*

>2.*Wrestlers protest and nothing happened*

>*3. Ladakh Protest*

>4. Not attending and not even acknowledging the protests and meeting the agitated is basic responsibility of a govt. Whether the demands are reasonable/feasible/logical or not is secondary. If govt believes they are unreasonable then govt should atleast meet them and explain and sort things out.*

5. Extreme Misuse of agencies does not matter.

6. Press freedom does not matter. PM holding an open press conference and being held accountable does not matter. PM coming to the the parliament and answering questions does not matter.

7. Passing bills without any discussion or debate does not matter

8. Suspending MPs for raising their voice does not matter, Mass suspension also does not matter

9. Use of governors to interfere in state govts functioning does not matter

10. Washing machine politics does not matter. People dont care

11. Communalism and Hate speech does not matter

12. Toppling govts doesnt matter

13. Election Commission and its discharge of constitutional duties does not matter

14. Using PMLA and UAPA on civil society activists does not matter

15. Electoral bonds does not matter
16. Covid mishandling does not matter

17. Weakening of democracy does not matter. CAG / RTI is being diluted..

18. Heck, rejecting opposition candidates’ nominations, forcing them to withdraw and win uncontested without even a single vote being cast like it happened in Indore,Surat and In Arunachal Pradesh, 10 BJP MLAs have been declared elected unopposed (they have simultaneous assembly and lok sabha elections)

19. I also have a distant fear that once NRC is brought in and implemented, Muslims might be particularly at the receiving end and a significant number of them might be declared as infiltrators. I dont know why I feel this , but I feel this more so after PM gave a blatant hate speech saying Muslims are those who have more kids and are infiltrators…

20. Delimitation if not done properly will make the south politically irrelevant because UP + Bihar will have equal political influence of that of the entire south.

21. Add above delimitation and the way they undermine Rajya Sabha by bypassing bills by introducing them as money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, further reduces the states political power in the federal structure.

The list is endless and these are some of the major things that come to my mind and are certainly gloomy.

I seriously don’t have energy to fight the whataboutery and falsehoods spread about the INDIA Alliance..

Remember in India politics is not who is good and better than the other but rather who is the lesser evil…and it’s clear who the lesser evil is.

Amazing how People are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure. 

Its highly likely that BJP will return to power for 3rd term on their own. As much as I don’t want BJP to return , I’m starting to lose hope and I’m starting to believe in what Bhakts say , “Ayega toh modi hi” ,

1cwaeyy,India,general elections 2024,A 17yo rich kid in Pune killed 2 people while drunk driving and got away with it in a day. People of pune need your help.,"Last sunday, 19th May 2024, Anish Awadiya and Ashwini Koshta were struck and killed by Vedant Agarwal, 17, who was driving a Porshe Taycan (with no license plate) under the influence of alcohol. Vedant Agarwal is the son of well known builder Vishal Agarwal, the owner of Bramha Realty and Infrastructure. Due to his connections with the police and politicians, Vedant got out on bail in under a day. The lawyer representing him, Adv Prashant Patil, has been associated with the likes of people like Jacqueline Fernandez, Suraj Pancholi and many others.

Vedant, along with 2 of his friends were seen partying in nearby clubs in Kalyani Nagar. They returned to their car drunk at 3:15AM, and Vedant forced his driver to let him drive the car, even though the driver kept asking him to not do it. The Agarwal family is now trying to shift the blame on the innocent driver, making it look like he was the one who was driving when the accident took place. According to law, Vedants father too should be facing prosecution and jailtime.

The deceased, Anish and Ashwini, came from Madhya Pradesh in search of job opportunities and were working in IT companies. There is very little coverage about the victims and their backgrounds. Imagine what their families must be going through. Pune police has failed miserably in providing them justice.

We demand justice for the victims' families, and we refuse to let the influence of wealth and connections overshadow the gravity of this tragedy. We request you all to please share news regarding this story or this post on your social media handles. Share it with friends, family, Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Whatsapp groups, anything works. Tag MLA's, MP's, and other politicians in your posts. Even though we have all lost faith in the local government, we can write letters to activists, police departments, and public representatives, and demand strict action. Protests have taken place in Kalyani Nagar and surrounding areas. People in the locality held a condolence meet for the victims' families too, but again there is very little coverage so they're struggling to make their voices heard. We can all help by reposting tweets about them. Please also repost and retweet posts regarding this incident.

1d9d4hb,India,general elections 2024,[URGENT] Massive Irregularities Uncovered in NEET Exam – Please Help us! ,"NEET, the only exam for medical school admissions in India, is currently embroiled in a controversy due to significant irregularities detected this year. We want to Raise awareness.

1.Score Discrepancies:
 The cutoff has been following a steady trend for the last few years.  An increase of cutoff by 10-20 marks is expected, and we were all expecting a rank jump of few thousands. However, this year a jump by 50 marks in the cutoff has been observed. People getting 650 out of 720 will not get a seat, with a rank of 40k! Last year it was 6k rank at the same marks! Inflation of over 6 times. This abnormality demands immediate attention and investigation.

 2.	Unusual Perfect Scores: 
6-12 students from a single exam centre in Haryana achieved perfect scores of 720/720. The probability of that is so small it nears impossible!

3.	Spike in Perfect Scores: Unlike previous years, where only a 2/3 MAX achieved a perfect score, this year saw an alarming surge, with 67 students attaining the highest possible marks.
 
4.	Ranking Anomalies: Anomalies in ranking, such as a student with a perfect score of 720 obtaining an AIR of 1.54.

5.	Grace marks: Numerous students have reported scores of 718/719 in the NEET exam, which contradicts NEET's scoring system. The NTA attributes these anomalies to ""grace marks"" and ""normalization,"". In recent statements they have even said it is to combat coaching mafia influence, which makes no sense and raises suspicions of a cover-up. The criteria, basis, and extent of these adjustments remain unclear. 

6.	Paper Leak Allegations: The NEET exam has been marred by allegations of paper leaks, with the recent Patna case revealing a definite leak. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of the exam process and demands a thorough investigation.

7.	Suspicious Timing: The release of the results 10 days earlier than expected (June 14), suspiciously coinciding with the Indian election results, has raised eyebrows, especially considering NTA's history of not releasing results so soon. They know the media houses and general population will be preoccupied. The supreme court, too is out of session and will not resume until July 7th. By that time counselling would have started. If they had released the result on 14th there would still be a chance of cases to be heard.

Please help us. Tens of thousands of lives of students are at stake. Please Raise awareness. If any of you are lawyers/activists or have experience in such cases tell us what we can do. Please bring to the attention of journalists.
 NTA has time and time shown itself to be an organisation that does not care about the students, and one we cannot trust.  The pleas of students are never heard. Similar incidents happened in JEE main this year yet all they did is deny. Please Please don’t let this get swept up under the rug too.",2250,0.95,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1d9d4hb/urgent_massive_irregularities_uncovered_in_neet/,Antique_Effective_64,2024-06-06 08:14:27
1e2zuyl,India,general elections 2024,Guidelines to deal with Andh-bhakts (Roadmap till 2029 general election),"For past decade, specially for last 5 years most of us are fighting ideological battles on different level. Due to the radicalization in politics, opinion are getting divided on every factor of life. But most will agree that fighting larger battle with system is easier than dealing with your dear ones who are now brainwashed and have became Andh-bhakts (or it can be that these people were always like this but now they have just become vocal due to the toxic environment which accepts this behaviour).

This years Lok sabha election was clear indication that major population is not brainwashed, infact these Andh-bhakts vote banks are in minority (the irony) and if we keep pushing like this then this radicalization will keep decreasing till next election. 

But this fight is causing too much damage to relations, with my personal experience of fighting ideological battle I would like to share guidelines with all who would like to continue this fight, but don't want to damage relationship with closed ones.

Guidlines -

1. First and foremost do not call an Individual directly Andh-bhakt (even if they are one). Because ones you insult them on personal level then they will always deny and ignore your opinion. So we should keep using Andh-Bhakts term but not on their face but to call out a group or type of people.


2. Be ready with facts - Whenever political discussion start first thing they do is to praise their supreme leader. Be ready with proof facts and blunders made by the current government so you can counter them.


3. Do not argue, instead ask questions! So while debating on these topics start asking questions instead of arguing with them. There is reason why they are called Andh-bhakts they don't have any concrete facts or studies their only source of knowledge are godi media propoganda, WhatsApp university and cheap Instagram/YouTube reels. So when you start asking valid questions they will get uncomfortable.


4. Listen to their praises for supremo - Do listen to their reason of why they support current government. Once you listen carefully two things will happen, they will trust you and listen to you as well and second thing is you can find false information in their reason and can use to counter it and correct them on the spot.


5. Make collection of facts - Use Instagram, YouTube etc and save or bookmark reels and articles. So you will have ready ammunition to throw at them right away. Catching them by surprise.


6. Instead of wasting energy to correct individual focus on spreading awareness and positivity - If you keep fighting one person to change their mindset it will never happen. Humans are stubborn (just look at you. Hoe you are fighting whole world!), so instead be firm on your opinion and keep spreading awareness. Love and positivity will always prevail over hate and negativity.


7. Do criticize Opposition as well - We call them Andh-Bhakts because they blindly support only one side. So we also don't want to do that, so we should also criticise to everyone who is in wrong. Be it opposition, International 3rd party or Minority. This will increase our credibility.


8. Praise Government as well! Yes you heard it right! Don't just keep criticising government, if something is done right by current government then don't hesitate to praise them, again this will add some credibility.


9. Don't ever say that only after 2014 we are in bad phase - Instead talk about how we need to raise voice against any government if they are wrong. Be firm on belief that government works for us, not vice versa.


10. Do not break friendship or good relations over political opinions - The thing is government will come and go, but people around you, your friends, family, colleagues they are the one who are with you for lifetime. They are the one who will help you in your need. So discuss with them but don't get angry or frustrated be more understanding. You already know you have better reasoning mind than them so be grateful and be patient, don't lose your loved ones over shitty phase of our country. 

Also, in my experience I have learned that most of Andh-bhakts even when they know that their paw-paw is wrong still they don't accept it, reason being their pride! We as human hate to be proven wrong, so they are ready to die on fighting that hill. So understand this and instead of defeating them win them slowly and steadily.

After all love, hope and forgiveness are one of the strongest emotions of our world. So we should always abide by them.

4th June 2023 was very unexpected day, even in such hopeless situation we saw power of democracy showing its place to a tyrannical regime, so next 5 years are more hopeful. 

Change don't happen over night, it will happen slowly and steadily. If we don't lose our hope and abide by our ethics we just might win and get rid of this hate-ridden atmosphere in our country!

P.S. - I would like if you all also can add more points to this list. Also, do share experiences about your ideological battles!",32,0.67,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1e2zuyl/guidelines_to_deal_with_andhbhakts_roadmap_till/,saurabh5796,2024-07-14 11:16:02
1cvnucz,India,general elections 2024,The frenzy around the general elections makes no sense to me. ,"Every five years, we witness people get into a frenzy before and during any elections, especially if the election in question is a general election. For me personally, all of this frenzy makes no sense to me, whether it be the antics of BJP supporters or the antics of Congress supporters. To me, both the BJP and the Congress are merely the two sides of the same coin, if one understands that the interests of both parties are aligned with the interests of the oppressor caste capitalist and landlord ruling classes. 

I'd first like to address those who're supporting the BJP:

Under the garb of ""development"" and ""investment"", what y'all are really doing is nothing more than facilitating the loot and plunder of our country by the various imperialist powers of the world, specifically selling off our country and its rich resources to the tender mercies of US imperialism. And to prevent anyone from protesting against this loot and plunder, y'all aren't just happy with destroying the communal harmony of this country, you're also taking away the bare minimum of features that allows the Indian State to at least pretend that it's ""democratic"". I'm not saying and I'm never gonna say that the Congress or its supporters are better than you, because they are mere mirror reflections of you, but that the only difference between you two is that you guys managed to destroy our country in ten years that the Congress took sixty years to do - which perhaps reflects an increase in the efficiency of screwing over this country and its people. The material conditions of our country has been bad, and y'all are more than happy to make it even worse, just so that the oppressor caste capitalist and landlord ruling classes that you guys are unwittingly serving get a higher profit margin. 

To those who're supporting the Congress:

All of the talk about the ""death of democracy"" that you guys engage in makes me laugh in both annoyance and incredulity. ""Death of democracy""? This country has never been democratic in its ""independent"" history, and the Congress has been the first party to destroy that façade of ""democracy"" that you and BJP supporters tuggle over in your rhetoric. In many cases, the Congress themselves have been responsible for setting the stage for the BJP to come into power, where the socio-economic policies of the Congress has not been any different from that of the BJP. All of the posturing that the Congress has been doing are policies that the Congress didn't even consider to carry out while they were in power, but now, they're talking about it solely because they wanna win a Parliamentary majority against the BJP. Such political opportunism sickens me, as much as the fascism of the BJP does. 

TLDR: Neither the Congress nor the BJP is the answer. The only way to make to truly make our country into an actual sovereign, socialist and democratic republic is through a revolutionary movement aimed against feudalism and imperialism. Otherwise, no amount of voting can change this situation.

1ecmk0w,India,general elections 2024,What happened to people who said they’re Voting for dictatorship and infrastructure?,"Its quite funny and sad at the same time to see BJP bhakts and ardent supporters fuming over the recent budget.

These people were the ones who said no problem even if inflation skyrockets , we will vote for Modiji, even if fuel prices hit 500₹ / litre and a cylinder costs 5000₹..

What ever happened to the ultra nationalistic sentiment and pride these people chided in? What happened to people who said they’re Voting for dictatorship and infrastructure? Where are they?

Why don’t they want to contribute to Vikasit Bharat? 

Why are they unhappy in Ram Rajya?

Why are they not content with their taxes being used to build international infrastructure and smart cities like that of Pragati Maidan, Bharat Mandapam, Mumbai, Delhi, Ayodhya, Airports and the engineering marvels of Bridges in Bihar, the engineering marvels of railway tracks and railways that they collide or go off track

Arent they anti-nationals? And anyone who echoed slight criticism was rapidly and ruthlessly attacked and labelled anti-nationals.

**They deserve every bit of it and more but unfortunately cannot wish for it because in their quest towards strongman cultish dictatorship they will take everything and everyone down with them.**

Oh the irony that if congress came to power they will raise taxes, bring in inheritance tax, take away your buffaloes, water taps, gold, flats etc, was the rhetoric during the election campaign

And lets remember, among BJP’s strong supporters are those urban class voters in large numbers too.

Now someone in the comments will still have the audacity to say Congress is worse, there is no alternative, and still believe in the false myths propagated by BJP about Congress in general and its manifesto and etc etc.
 
I wont really spend time trying to combat your false myths about Congress etc because its you have drank too much of BJP’s Vikasit Bharat and ultranationalistic pride akin to drinking MAGAbility kool-aid in the US. There’s a reason why such people are called andhbhakts.

If youre upset with the current tax raj, read up on congress’s manifesto on what they had proposed and you’ll find what you wish for now but unfortunately wont happen atleast for a few years or until the govt changes..*(I have tooo little hopes that those govt listens to feedback and outrage and protests and mend their ways or rollback certain proposals)*

And yes, Congress has a ton of problems too, but ultimately its the lesser of two evils in politics unfortunately.

Will write up criticism sometime soon about congress too.

1bqhtai,India,general elections 2024,Elections 2024,I wanted to speak about current elections and am looking for advice too. I'm not a bjp voter. I've voted only once in my life in Gujarat legislative elections for the Congress party. But I'm also very anti left. Kejriwal's arrest really scared me. Bjp is openly going against the opposition. I was upset about sisodia and other people's arrest too. This is putin territory. But the Congress has also taken a very left turn. Their left language is scary and I worry about us going pre 91 days if they come to power. I've full confidence in leftist policies increasing poverty and misery as they've a very strong global track record of doing. Also I'm concerned about the caste census and increasing reservations beyond what we have today which I think is something like 60 percent. I could never vote for the bjp. But I couldn't in good conscience vote for congress against the interests of my own family and also I think it's not in general interest either. But the bjp is going too far and jailing political opponents and that is unacceptable.I know one vote doesn't count for anything but I'm eager to listen to your opinions and maybe advice. ,0,0.4,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1bqhtai/elections_2024/,bamboo-forest-s,2024-03-29 05:49:59

As the 2024 elections loom, learn about his extraordinary journey in politics and choosing an unconventional career following an MBA from XLRI","We're thrilled to announce an exclusive opportunity for an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session with Sanjay Jha, a prominent Indian politician and ex-spokesperson for the Indian National Congress (INC) party.   
 

Date: 26th March  
 

Time: 5:00 PM  
 

Sanjay Jha has been a significant figure in Indian politics, extremely hard to ignore, and clearly different from the conventional stereotype. He is an outlier of Indian politics, probably the only one in India to have not switched sides in the Age of Aaya Ram Gaya Ram migrations.   
 

Sanjay has a Post Graduate degree in Economics from Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, Pune University, and an MBA from XLRI Jamshedpur, specialising in HR. He has also done a PhD in Economics. He was the national spokesperson for the Indian National Congress party until July 2020. He was also the President of All India Professionals Congress, Maharashtra.  
 

Sanjay has written several articles and books on the current Indian political scene, including the bestseller The Great Unravelling: India After 2014. His earlier book My Illegitimate Son: A True story has won several hearts and featured recently at the JLF. [His latest book 2024: India in Free Fall has just launched last month and is available online](https://www.amazon.in/2024-India-Free-Sanjay-Jha/dp/9356998892)

# tl;dr

This election season was marked by widespread use of technology to create deceptive or misleading synthetic content like ‘cheapfakes’ and ‘deepfakes’. Action against political actors violating the Model Code of Conduct (“MCC”) and other legal instruments was delayed and inadequate. As we trace the Election Commission of India’s (“ECI”) response during this election period we notice that it faltered in upholding the sanctity and legitimacy of the Lok Sabha elections.

# Why should you care? 

Free and fair elections are an integral pillar of democracy. But this Lok Sabha election has seen [~several instances~](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/factcheck-misinformation-roundup-phase-2-evm-reservation-cropped-video-amit-shah-communal-claims-fake-news-25182?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of circulation of disinformation and falsely contextualised content, including content with misleading communal narratives. Here, it becomes important to consider voters’ potential inability to distinguish between real and [~synthetic content~](https://promiseinstitute.law.ucla.edu/podcast/misinformation-and-synthetic-media/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and their vulnerability to deception. AI-powered disinformation [~campaigns~](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/disinformation-propaganda-amplification-ampliganda/620334/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) can influence voter behaviour by spreading false narratives or amplifying divisive content. This fundamentally affects the ability of citizens to exercise their democratic right to cast a free and informed vote. 

# The letter we awaited and were disappointed by 

On May 06, 2024, ECI sent a [~letter~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1883JzsDeKPptlVwPdRbP2rmAG1DqXexy/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to all national/state recognised political parties, cautioning them against the “*use of deep fakes, AI-generated distorted content which spread fake information/misinformation/disinformation and distortions of facts*”. ECI directed political parties to follow the provisions of the MCC and other existing legislations. This response came after two of the seven phases for the Lok Sabha seats had ended and there had been widespread dissemination of AI-generated misleading content. 

It also followed the [~decision~](https://dhcappl.nic.in/dhcorderportal/GetOrder.do?ID=mmh%2F2024%2F1714640768016_2024.pdf&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in a Writ Petition filed by a lawyers’ organisation requesting action from ECI on the circulation of deepfakes. The Court chose to let ECI examine the matter and “*decide this as expeditiously as possible on or before May 6, keeping in view the urgency of the matter involved, in accordance with law*”. 

In February 2024, we [~urged~](https://internetfreedom.in/open-letter-on-deepfakes/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) political representatives to publicly commit not to use manipulative technology to create deceptive or misleading synthetic content in the run-up to and during the 2024 general elections. Eleven civil society organisations including IFF had [~written~](https://internetfreedom.in/civil-society-writes-to-eci-on-2024-elections/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) an open letter to ECI and state Chief Electoral Officers, flagging concerns about generative AI technology (particularly deepfakes) used by political actors for influencing voter perception and impacting electoral outcomes.

ECI’s letter dated May 06 used terms such as “*misinformation”, “patently false”, “untrue”, and “misleading”* which is reflective of the vague and arbitrary language used in the amended Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“IT Amendment Rules, 2023”). Reliance on such undefined terms allows for its misuse through subjective application and selective enforcement. Further, the [~recent instances~](https://www.boomlive.in/news/deepfakes-or-real-edited-videos-amit-shah-bjp-congress-rahul-gandhi-lok-sabha-elections-2024-ai-25107?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of mislabelling doctored/ edited media (i.e. cheapfakes) as deepfakes, or even [~authentic media~](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/bjp-mp-dinesh-lal-yadav-viral-video-on-unemployment-yogi-modi-children-is-not-a-deepfake-fact-check?ref=static.internetfreedom.in#read-more) as deepfakes raises concerns about disproportionate censorship in the wake of the direction issued by the ECI in the notice. Here, the awareness and ability of political parties to identify/detect AI-generated media must be realistically assessed. 

Various instances of use and dissemination of [~manipulated~](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/deepfakes-bollywood-stars-spark-worries-ai-meddling-india-election-2024-04-22/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)/[~misleading~](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/viral-video-allu-arjun-campaigning-support-congress-claim-social-media-24981?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) media of high-profile public figures expressing support for a political party were also reported. We wrote to the Bharatiya Janata Party (“BJP”) and Indian National Congress (“INC”) ([~here~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZlNIyIU1wi1-47EIwRPG5IrISUtn4xez/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and [~here~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sDzMC-miIjBWRwiAaYXsM8LCLfv01Fjx/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)), highlighting their responsibility of not endorsing any deceptive or misleading synthetic content, even if it disproportionately favours them, as that may deliberately misinform citizens and affect their ability to exercise their democratic right to cast a free and informed vote. In our [~letter~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FxoZPLh8ffCjI3r7Ur74eJmCIDP87n2L/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to ECI on May 9, 2024, we noted that they had failed to highlight this aspect and must consider directing the political parties and representatives to advocate against manipulated media, even ones that lead to a favourable outcome for them.

Additionally, despite several widely circulated pieces of content having misleading communal claims and allegations, both doctored/ manipulated and otherwise, the directions issued by ECI did not explicitly mention the party representative’s duty towards not spreading content that “*aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension between different castes and communities, religious or linguistic*” \[Paragraph 1(1) of the [~Model Code of Conduct~](https://www.eci.gov.in/mcc/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) (MCC)\]. In the notice, the ECI only lists “criticism of other political parties” \[Paragraph 1(2)\] from the MCC\] which should be followed by the political parties given the “subject matter”.

We [~wrote~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FxoZPLh8ffCjI3r7Ur74eJmCIDP87n2L/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to the ECI on May 13, 2024 citing the above stated and other similar concerns.  

# ECI’s report on the enforcement of MCC

On May 14, 2024, ECI [~reported~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gEEWelngFB0d9sIw0GhAxwJRgyZSFlb3/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on its two months of enforcement under MCC during Elections 2024 (“MCC enforcement report”). While we appreciated the intent of transparency, critical gaps were observed in their response. Firstly, ECI acknowledged its pending decision on divisive statements made by the candidates “*on communal, caste, regional language divide, or on the sanctity of the Constitution of India.*” An example of this was a [~post~](https://indianexpress.com/elections/ec-bjp-karnataka-x-post-muslims-9314058/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) by BJP’s Karnataka unit on X (formerly Twitter) which triggered nationwide outrage due to its communal attack on the INC. ECI did not directly warn or take action against the BJP, and only directed the Karnataka Police to take down the controversial post after it had [~garnered~](https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/ec-tells-x-to-immediately-take-down-karnataka-bjp-post-on-muslim-quota/article68149599.ece?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) 9.2 million views and 13,000 reshares. 

Despite wide [~coverage~](https://m.thewire.in/article/communalism/animated-videos-latest-in-bjps-arsenal-spread-anti-muslim-hate-and-disinformation/amp?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of communal content being posted online by political actors during the election period for voter appeasement, ECI failed to take notice of hate speeches being spread on the lines of caste, community, or religion at the right time. This is in spite of at least one national party filing a [~complaint~](https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/lok-sabha/story/karnataka-congress-chief-electoral-officer-complaint-bjp-communal-hatred-ill-intention-twitter-video-muslim-reservation-2535423-2024-05-05?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) against the BJP to ECI for the aforementioned post and other content posted by the party that too violates the MCC, Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Indian Penal Code, 1860.

Two weeks after this incident on X and a week after the release of the MCC enforcement report, ECI finally issued a [~warning~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IOZU9eVdPNCqLaJlcS8mlF5px0-sztOs/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on May 22, 2024 to the BJP and INC, asking the two political parties to desist from campaigning along caste, community, language, and communal lines. It asked BJP President JP Nadda and INC Chief Mallikarjun Kharge to issue formal notes to their star campaigners asking them to “*not make speeches and statements, which may divide the society*”, “*refrain from any campaigning methods/utterances along religious/communal lines*”,  and “ *maintain decorum in their utterances*”.

This deterrent action should have been taken as soon as such incidents were reported at the beginning of the elections, and not when five out of the seven phases of elections were done. ECI’s delayed, inadequate and selective action in addressing crucial issues like this puts a serious dent on the electoral integrity and accountability of ECI as an institution. 

Additionally, the MCC enforcement report did not mention the terms ‘deepfakes’, ‘cheapfakes’, ‘false’, ‘misleading’, or ‘misinformation’ even once, and only once mentioned the term ‘morphed images’. This omission is surprising given the dominance of such manipulated/edited media in the general elections. Regarding ECI’s instruction to take down deepfake content within [~3 hours~](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remove-deepfakes-within-3-hours-of-being-notified-election-commission-to-political-parties-101715023235465.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), it was unclear whether the parties were expected to [~identify~](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/bjp-mp-dinesh-lal-yadav-viral-video-on-unemployment-yogi-modi-children-is-not-a-deepfake-fact-check?ref=static.internetfreedom.in#read-more) the content themselves or whether this responsibility falls on some other entity. Throughout the election process, the parties had a responsibility under the premise of good faith to inform the voters that a particular manipulated/misleading media is being circulated and that the party does not officially associate with it, even if it benefits them disproportionately. This accountability was completely absent from the side of the political parties and their members. 

ECI’s sparing response to the use of deepfakes and other forms of edited/distorted content which spreads disinformation has been delayed, dispiriting, and limited in scope. This impacted electoral integrity and the level of political discourse in the country amid a crucial democratic moment. 

The MCC enforcement report also highlighted the C-Vigil App's robustness in reporting MCC violations during elections. However, shortly before the release of this report, citizens [~shared~](https://scroll.in/article/1067615/ordinary-voters-flagged-modi-speech-to-election-commission-and-came-up-against-a-broken-system?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) their experience of being unable to [~upload~](https://www.boomlive.in/decode/lok-sabha-elections-2024-election-commission-app-cvigil-25204?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) pre-recorded videos or link to social media content. For some users, the app did not work on either Android or iOS phones, preventing them from reporting violations occurring in the digital space.

The other mechanism through which voters tried to complain to ECI was over emails because the official channels did not work. But even this avenue failed. There was no way to ensure action or a follow-up when it came to email complaints. This highlights the ECI’s inadequate grievance redressal system and the lack of a transparent mechanism to hold accountability over poll code violations.

# Free and Fair 

Seven phases. Two months. 543 seats. Over 96 crore voters.

Indian voters participated in the largest-ever election in the world to elect Members of Parliament to the 18th Lok Sabha. Concurrently, elections have taken place for the Legislative Assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Sikkim and by-elections for 35 seats in 16 states.

New Delhi, April 08, 2024: Earlier today, 11 civil society organisations [wrote](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1svYMfe5KclydjdLaCP9fRGH34fjuKjme/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to  the Election Commission of India (“ECI”) in a collaborative effort,  highlighting the role of technology in affecting electoral processes and  outcomes. The letter includes an urgent appeal to the ECI to uphold the  integrity of the upcoming elections and hold political parties,  candidates, and digital platforms accountable to the voters. 

The signatories to the letter are [Article 21 Trust](https://www.article21trust.org/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [Association for Democratic Reforms](https://adrindia.org/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [Campaign Against Hate Speech](https://hatespeechbeda.wordpress.com/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [Common Cause](https://www.commoncause.in/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [Internet Freedom Foundation](https://internetfreedom.in/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [LibTech India](https://libtech.in/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [Maadhyam](https://linktr.ee/Maadhyam?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan](https://mkssindia.org/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [National Alliance of People's Movements](https://napmindia.wordpress.com/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [Rajasthan Asangathit Mazdoor Union](https://www.ramuindia.org/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), and [Software Freedom Law Center, India](https://sflc.in/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). 

Following are the concerns and appeals outlined in the joint letter:

1. **Online campaigning and surrogate advertisements**:  Expenditure on surrogate advertising and targeted online campaigns by  political actors to influence voter perception and beliefs are not under  adequate scrutiny. The ECI must increase the accountability of  political parties and digital platforms by adopting internationally  acceptable, rights-respecting standards for regulating political  expenditure on online ads and targeted campaigning. 
2. **Use of emerging technologies such as deepfakes**:  The use of generative AI technology (particularly deepfakes) by  political actors with the intent to influence voter perception and  impact electoral outcomes raises urgent concerns. The ECI must introduce  measures to increase the accountability of political actors who deploy  generative AI with the intent of influencing voter perceptions and  political narratives.
3. **Inadequacies of the Voluntary  Code of Conduct:** The  Voluntary Code of Conduct is non-binding, has no legal force, and was  drafted without any transparency and input from civil society. Lower  standards are applied to digital platforms in India as compared to other  jurisdictions, there is no monitoring of platforms’ compliance, and  there is a lack of redressal for voters in case of non-compliance. The  ECI should initiate a transparent and participatory process spearheaded  by a third-party, independent organisation(s) to arrive at a Model Code  of Conduct (“MCC”) to be followed by political candidates and digital  platforms - with clear enforcement guidelines and reporting mechanisms.
4. **Voter surveillance:** The  use of facial recognition and video surveillance technology at polling  booths can deter the right to vote without fear or coercion, may violate  the right to privacy, and is antithetical to a free and fair election.  The ECI should initiate a careful reevaluation of the implementation of  surveillance technologies in electoral processes and assess it against  strict standards of legality, necessity and proportionality.

18yzvyl,India,general elections 2024,Let the Die be Cast: Countering BJP's Campaign Ahead of the 2024 General Election,"**वो सुब्ह हमीं से आएगी**  
**जब धरती करवट बदलेगी, जब क़ैद से क़ैदी छूटेंगे**  
**जब पाप घरौंदे फूटेंगे, जब ज़ुल्म के बंधन टूटेंगे**  
**उस सुब्ह को हम ही लाएँगे, वो सुब्ह हमीं से आएगी**

BJP has unleashed a massive propaganda campaign ahead of the 2024 General Election. This campaign can be summed up as two strategies. On one hand, they are trying to galvanize their supporters with the issue of Ram Mandir. On the other hand, they are trying to demoralize their opponents.

BJP has gone into a hyperdrive to exploit the Ram Mandir for its political gains, which has become their single issue agenda this election. In the last 30 years, the party has fought every single election on the issue of Ram Mandir. When, Advani began his Rath Yatra in 1991, which culminated in nationwide riots, BJP maintained that its only objective was the construction of Ram Mandir. After the 2019 Ayodhaya Judgement by the Supreme Court, its proponents claimed that this would lay this matter to a rest, and the nation can finally move forward to actual issues.

Yet, Modi kept milking this agenda. When the nation was reeling under the COVID lockdown, BJP devised a plan to distract the attention by organizing a grand stone-laying ceremony, and broadcasting the Ramayana TV show. BJP also devised a clever scheme to keep their kettle boiling with the Kashi-Mathura agenda. This is despite the fact that both Advani and Vajpayee had publicly denied this agenda several times.

In recent years, this agenda has led to a capture of our religious festivals by political mobs. Hindutva organizations like Bajrang Dal have orchestrated violence during Ram Navami for political gains. A report by Ashutosh Varshney and Bhanu Joshi, reveals how this trend of violence during Ram Navami began from 1980s, when BJP began its strategy of using Ram for capturing power.

And now, with massive social, economic and political crisis unfolding in India, and the complete tyranny and incompetence of the administration writ large, BJP has fallen back into the feet of Lord Ram to retain its power. Yet, this attempt at exploiting the religion and fooling the population is bound to fail. Imam-e-Hind will not bless these corrupt tyrants.

The other part of BJP's electoral strategy is to demoralize and dissuade its opponents and critics. BJP has been viciously pushing the narrative of TINA (there is no alternative) except Modi. They are trying to declare the victory before the fight. BJP has clearly underestimated the strength of our resistance.

2024 General Election is not an ordinary election. BJP has declared an assault against our republic. They have forcibly captured the Parliament, and intend to turn the democracy into a fascist regime. They have imprisoned journalists, academicians, and activists. They have clamped down on our right to information, and created a regime of mass surveillance, and repression.",4,0.53,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18yzvyl/let_the_die_be_cast_countering_bjps_campaign/,rishianand,2024-01-05 06:12:40

1cb212b,India,general elections 2024,Why is hate politics so accepatble in India?,"During a public meeting in Rajasthan, Prime Minister Modi made several controversial statements. Again on tuesday Modi  repeated that congress wants to Give reservation to muslims at cost of SC-ST and OBC Reservation.

*Here are Modi's claims and fact-check of these claims*

**Muslims Bearing More Children:**

* Modi referred to Muslims in India as “those who have a large number of children.”
* However, data shows that the claim that Muslims give birth to more children is **erroneous**. The **fertility rate** of Muslims, along with other religious groups, has been **drastically declining** over the years.
* As of 2019-21 data, the fertility rate of Muslims was **2.36**, which is much closer to the replacement level (average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime).
* [The gap between the fertility levels of Hindu and Muslim women has also reduced significantly in the past two decades1](https://www.thehindu.com/data/a-fact-check-on-modis-speech-in-rajasthan-about-muslims-and-manmohan-singh/article68095954.ece).

**Manmohan Singh’s Statement:**

* Modi claimed that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said (in 2006) that “Muslims had the first claim on the country’s resources.”
* However, this statement was **deliberately misinterpreted**. In reality, Dr. Singh’s statement was aimed at all vulnerable sections of society, including Muslims.
* Dr. Singh emphasized that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, should be empowered to share equitably in the fruits of development. [His focus was on ensuring equal opportunities for all1](https://www.thehindu.com/data/a-fact-check-on-modis-speech-in-rajasthan-about-muslims-and-manmohan-singh/article68095954.ece).

**Congress Manifesto and Wealth Distribution:**

* Modi alleged that the 2024 Congress manifesto proposes to distribute people’s wealth among Muslims if the party is elected to power.
* He combined sections in the manifesto addressing wealth inequality and connected them to Dr. Singh’s speech in 2006.
* [However, this claim lacks factual basis and appears to be a political assertion](https://www.thehindu.com/data/a-fact-check-on-modis-speech-in-rajasthan-about-muslims-and-manmohan-singh/article68095954.ece)

While Modi’s comments have sparked controversy, it’s essential to verify claims using reliable data and context. Dr. [Singh’s emphasis on empowering all vulnerable sections, including Muslims, was not exclusive but aimed at promoting equitable development](https://www.thehindu.com/data/a-fact-check-on-modis-speech-in-rajasthan-about-muslims-and-manmohan-singh/article68095954.ece).

1cpdea2,India,general elections 2024,Electoral politics is about choosing the lesser evil... And INDIA alliance is exactly that. ,"I reckon there are too many undecided apolitical people who say BJP and Congress are two sides of the same coin. However, the truth is that Congress and the INDIA alliance may be bad, but they are certainly not worse than BJP. Some of the undecided apolitical people may feel alienated by Congress' ""radical"" push for more affirmative action and the caste census, but I don't think it makes Congress akin to BJP. 

BJP engages in blatant communal bigotry. It uses central agencies like the ED to serve political vendetta. The press freedom and academic freedom indices go down almost every year. During the UPA era, the media talked about their scams, but no media criticizes the government now. UP's CM openly orders DMs to investigate any media reports criticizing the government.

As for the caste census, I believe that the Congress Party, which fought the last two elections on milquetoast centrism, felt that it needed an ideology (Mandal) to counter Hindutva politics (Kamandal) . Historically, this was the forte of parties like SP and RJD and not the Congress. In fact, historically Congress and BJP's stances on ""caste politics"" were pretty similar. 

I personally agree with the idea of a socioeconomic caste census as the data revealed by the one conducted in Bihar provides a lot of data to work with. It reveals the massive inequalities in resources. 

However, Congress's aggressive push has also resulted in BJP getting defensive on the issue of affirmative action and getting slightly desperate vis-a-vis reservation. They are now trying to communalize Congress' aggressive push for affirmative action and talk about how Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi opposed reservation. 

The truth is that this is only rhetoric. When it comes to ""caste politics"", even BJP has breached the 50% ceiling in several states, although the Supreme Court stalled it in some cases. In Haryana, after the Jat agitation, the BJP government brought 10% OBC reservation for Jats even though they are a dominant landowning community who own most of the land in the state. In Maharashtra, they brought a 10% quota for Marathas, who are a dominant caste, breaching the 50% ceiling. Centrists who don't like the BJP, but oppose ""caste politics"" must also contend with this. Of course, this is not to say that the opposition didn't support these bills. They also supported the bills for the same reason BJP did. 

I would also like to point out the 10% EWS reservation brought by the BJP also breached the 50% ceiling. The BJP advertised it as the first reservation for general castes. Was it not ""caste politics""??  I mean the definition of EWS is so lax that nearly everyone in the general category is included. (Less than 5% of families earn over 8 LPA, although privileged people like us may think otherwise) 

Even if you think from the perspective of someone who doesn't like ""caste politics"", I think BJP has all the problems that exist in the Congress, apart from communalism and authoritarianism. Congress is clearly the lesser evil. ",418,0.7,213,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1cpdea2/electoral_politics_is_about_choosing_the_lesser/,Balkans101,2024-05-11 09:14:24

1bfcwqb,India,general elections 2024,The Logic that just because BJP is a bigger party therefore it should have more funds doesn't make sense. ,"I can understand why you think this logic makes sense. But this logic is flawed for the following reasons

1) Parties get funded to run election campaigns and various political activities. These funds are not based on how many seats you win but rather how many seats you compete for. For example Congress would be competing with them for the same seats. Both would have to incur costs. So the number of seats they occupy isn't a fair measure but how many seats they run for would be the main criteria.
2) The funding received could be a little more or less based on the support they get from the general population, but these differences shouldn't be very significant because donations are from General Population. 
3) The fundings received here are from corporates and is much more than what is required for election campaigns. The corporates can't just donate money. Managers of Listed companies are agents of Shareholders (the general public). 
4) People who are insisting that corporates do this in other countries. First of all, lobbying is illegal in India. Why? Because a company may want to push agendas which might not be in line with the public's interest. The idea that just because you have more money, you have more influence would result in very significant income inequality resulting in rich people getting richer and poor people getting poorer. 
5) The countries where lobbying is legal, they'll have a lot of corruption going on. Having them as our gold standard is completely wrong. Secondly, even those countries have proper rules related to lobbying. This would still be illegal in those countries and termed as unethical lobbying.
6) A ruling party receiving funds is without any doubt can be deduced as quid pro quo. We might give certain companies projects not based on the quality/cost but how much money they are donating. This leads to tunnels collapsing, poor infrastructure and very less efficieny of taxpayer's money. 
7) A company doesn't give this amount of money if they're not getting more value from it. It's an investment for them and the returns are much more. It's not a ""donation"" at all.


Ps - downvoters, can you also debate me?

1bx5jp4,India,general elections 2024,Whom you vote now will have a direct influence on your Career and the Country's career so choose wisely.,"I felt this must be a topic of utmost importance to community. Not only we share and support each other in every turmoils and hardship by sharing experiences, but it is the time of the year for us to decide how our future needs to be. So, I believe this will make a good post.


Note: This post is just my opinion. You are under no obligation to agree with what I believe. Just see where I am coming from and see if my stance is correct or not. This will be the first time I vote and I decided to take this extremely seriously because this may also be the last time I vote. I am now excersizing my right to freedom of speech. 

***
First of all as a fellow citizen of India, you are free to vote whomever you like. But while doing so you as an individual must think twice before voting whom you are voting. Whichever party you choose you must make sure they Do Not fall under any of the below categories. Do not vote for Religion or Money.  

Do not support those parties which engage in
1. Forming Extremist groups
2. Violence promoting, Mob Lynching
3. Anti-Democratic activities 
4. Anti-Secular activities
5. Extremely corrupt and Power hungry
6. Biased or misinforming
7. Anti-constitutional activities 

As a ""Personal"" recommendation I urge you to support the India Bloc coalition out of no other choice. Why? You may ask.

Well, in any Democratic system, having a Strong Opposition is must to keep the balance of power. No one party must become too powerful. No one party must become unstoppable. No party must ever mess with the Constitution.

Unfortunately, the current government in power has become too powerful and it's out of public reach. The BJP backed by the RSS faction has caused havoc on the Nation and it will become too late to save the country from soon to be seen as a Dictatorship like Russia, China or N.Korea. I have seen Interviews on of top unbiased Journalist, leaders and even YouTubers like Dhruv Rathee and Deshbhakt and I agree with them that India is moving in that unacceptable direction.

Ask yourself. Haven't you seen the below happening under the influence of the current Govt?
1. Ladakh crisis
2. Manipur chaos
3. ED crisis
4. Inflation
5. Media restrictions and oppression of Free press
6. Attempts to turn India into a Hindu Nationalist country away from being all welcoming Secular peaceful Nation.
7. Promoting violence against other religions openly on big stages by certain Chief ministers 
8. Mass money laundering
9. Adani group, reliance, vedanta scams etc
10. Electoral bond crisis
11. Aggressively attempts to change the Constitution by winning 400 seats.
12. Attempts to infiltrate the electoral collegium 
13. Pressurising the Supreme court to overlook unconstitutional actions
14 . Naming anyone who opposes them as Anti-Nationalist or Pakistani 
15. Promoting mob lynching backed by RSS faction
16. Increase in taxes, cost of goods and fuel, cost of land, landownership etc
17. Changes in the Tax structure like Old regime and new regime (do you really think Old regime is going to stay with us forever?)
18. Certain unacceptable changes to the CRPC and IPC.

God forbid our country India slowly turning into a dictatorship because most people who received the fundamental right to vote by default by birth aren't even properly educated about what is happening in the country and those who are educated are praising our PM for all the wrong and ignorant reasons. 

So, please put your Religious and Caste difference aside for once and think of this Election as very special. Please vote and vote to maintain the balance of power. Don't vote for a person or a party. Nah nah that's not what I am saying. Always vote for the balance of power. 

By voting now, you are making sure there will be elections in the future. If you vote for Modi because of all his artificially created Hype, Media control and fake International outlook, then you can say goodbye to 2029 future general elections. And I hope I am proved wrong.

1dh4p91,India,voting 2024,"One reason for BJP's poor performance is not discussed | ""Winning"" close seats","I think one reason for BJP's poor performance is not discussed much. Dr. Sabyasachi in his [paper](https://digpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SSRN-id4512936.pdf) titled ""Democratic Backsliding in World's Largest Democracy"" clearly showed that in 2019, BJP won a disproportionate amount of close seats.  The main graph in that paper is the following figure. This is a histogram (counts) where the x-axis is %-margin of victory divided by 100 in the seats bjp won or ended up as the runner up. A negative win margin implies BJP lost that seat with that amount of margin whereas a positive win margin implies BJP won that seat.

https://preview.redd.it/4xsb349uqw6d1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=352cbf3fe3d6268ed2472b8e87d20e7327b9e35d

When the election is very close in a particular seat, it is basically a toss up and hence should roughly win as many seats it loses. Therefore the following graph should be continuous at 0. We see a clear discontinuity indicating BJP somehow won a MUCH higher number of close seats than it lost. Compare this with the win margin of Congress in 2019

https://preview.redd.it/kw4rq736sw6d1.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=967c77d9c14b29988ab30a5508a794b39c79dd1c

A continuous graph at 0 implying there that it lost as many seats as it won when those seats are very close. You can also look the same graph for 2009 and 2014 elections for BJP

https://preview.redd.it/coysgudgvw6d1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=796b35cba3b1306fe508c3d6da9f46bd4a1a5b3e

Once again, a continuous graph at the origin which is what we should expect in a fair election (especially in a country like India). **This clearly indicates that in 2019, BJP gained seats using manipulation**. The author, using some excellent analysis, estimates that BJP gained around 9-11 ""excess seats"" last time. He also analyses the details of how they ""stole"" these seats such as removing muslim names from electorate, mismatch of votes from EVM, Assignment of Counting Observers, Turnout Manipulation in High Muslim Share Areas and pliability in BJP ruled states. I highly recommend the paper.

Now, coming back to 2024 election, I plotted the data to get a histogram and obtained the following:

https://preview.redd.it/z4fo1cwcuw6d1.png?width=1265&format=png&auto=webp&s=664d37865a9f77e2634680536fc64df2a98c5eeb

**This time the graph is continuous at 0 implying that BJP couldn't/didn't steal the close ""excess seats"" for whatever reason.**

It would be interesting to find the reasons for this. Last time, most of these ""excess seats"" were from local parties and independents (as Congress graph is continuous rather than downward discontinous).

These are the points where I felt a comparison was possible.

After reading both manifestos, I feel BJP's focus is on visible infrastructure development. This is reinforced through their promises of expanding roads, modernising train stations, introducing high speed railways (eg. bullet trains) and increasing the number of international airports. This is good, and these facilities will be of particular interest to the upper middle class folks (like me, and probably most of this subreddit).

BJP reaffirms its support for the Ram temple by promising Ramayan festivals throughout the world that celebrate the temple's consecration. It also reaffirms its support for CAA, uniform civil code and one nation one election. The manifesto completely ignores the situation in Manipur and does not answer when centre's rule will be lifted in Kashmir.

Congress, on the other hand, focuses on social justice. It calls for civil union for LGBT couples, talks of forcing increased  representations for marginalsed communities, aims to implement farmer's demands, restore the independence of India's institutions and promises to safeguard individual liberty.

In my opinion, the choice is between the promise of visible indicators of development (high speed trains, multiple airports) but an unequal society (with minorities persecuted and wealth disparity) and a country with basic but not fancy infrastructure (think more normal trains but no bullet trains) and the promise of a more equal society (where the state does not discriminate on the basis of faith and actively promotes marginalised communities).",35,0.76,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1c4kl71/analysis_of_the_congress_bjp_manifesto_for_2024/,rahulthewall,2024-04-15 12:09:13
1abad4s,India,voting 2024,"A Desecration of the Republic, and Our Tryst with Destiny","When the Preamble to the Constitution of India was being drafted, there was a debate on God. HV Kamath, member of the Constituent Assembly, had moved an amendment to replace, “We, the people of India”, with “In the name of God, We, the People of India”. The amendment was fiercely debated by the Constituent Assembly, and was finally put to vote. There were 41 ayes and 68 noes. We gave to ourselves a secular constitution. We adopted a democratic republic, which drew its authority from the people of India, not from a divine sanction. Our leaders were to be elected by the people, not appointed by the God. After a long struggle and countless sacrifices, India had awoken to life and freedom, and we decided to rid ourselves of the past, and walk into a new future that beckoned us. However, there were challenges ahead, and many apprehensions about the future of this republic.

In a speech to the Constituent Assembly, on 4 November 1948, Dr Ambedkar, noted the importance of Constitutional Morality,

> Constitutional morality is not a natural sentiment. It has to be cultivated. We must realize that our people have yet to learn it. Democracy in India is only a top-dressing on an Indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic.

He further cautioned against the perversion of the Constitution,

> It is perfectly possible to pervert the Constitution, without changing its form by merely changing the form of the administration and to make it inconsistent and opposed to the spirit of the Constitution.

On 25 November 1949, in his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Br Ambedkar further warned against the misuse of the Constitution,

> However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot

> The working of a Constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of the Constitution. The Constitution can provide only the organs of State such as the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. The factors on which the working of those organs of the State depends are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics.

India had achieved her freedom in a non-violent democratic struggle, which was exceptional in history. Yet, there were many fault lines in the new nation. India was a nation of diverse religions, languages, cultures, and castes. Our freedom struggle had united India, beyond these divisions. Yet, there were many groups who saw this diversity as a threat and wanted to impose their narrow understanding upon the nation.

Dr Ambedkar noted,

> On 26th January 1950, India will be an independent country. What would happen to her independence? Will she maintain her independence or will she lose it again?… Will history repeat itself? It is this thought which fills me with anxiety. This anxiety is deepened by the realization of the fact that in addition to our old enemies in the form of castes and creeds we are going to have many political parties with diverse and opposing political creeds. Will Indian place the country above their creed or will they place creed above country? I do not know. But this much is certain that if the parties place creed above country, our independence will be put in jeopardy a second time and probably be lost for ever. This eventuality we must all resolutely guard against. **We must be determined to defend our independence with the last drop of our blood.**

In many ways, on 22 January 2024, fears and apprehensions expressed by Dr Ambedkar came true. As a leader elected by the people proclaimed himself as one appointed by the God, as a consecration of a temple took place on the desecration of the republic, as a secular state used all the political and administrative power to hail it as the true freedom, as the democracy was turned into a theocracy, our constitution was torn to shreds.

It is said that, after the Constitution of the US was adopted, someone asked Benjamin Franklin whether they had got a republic or a monarchy. To this, Benjamin Franklin replied, “A republic if you can keep it”.

For long years, we took our Republic for granted. We ignored the mobs who sought to turn a secular nation into a Hindu Rahstra. We ignored the attempts to turn the democratic republic into a theocratic autocracy. While thousands marched to destroy this constitution, few marched to defend it.

We could not uphold this constitution, bestowed upon us by our freedom fighters. We could not protect this republic, for which countless people gave their lives. We could not preserve the dream of our leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Maulana Azad, Bhagat Singh. And we failed in the responsibility entrusted upon us.

The question that remains before us is, will we turn our back to this adversity, will be surrender our republic to those who betrayed our freedom movement, will we be the generation that failed? Or will be fight back?

On this very day, when Jawaharlal Nehru gave the call for Purna Swaraj, and when the Constitution of India came into force, or nation stands at a crossroads. It is a moment of reckoning in our collective tryst with destiny. The country's future hangs between hope and despair. Another term for the BJP-RSS at the centre could mean formal rewriting and de-facto abrogation of the Constitution. Dethroning the current regime by democratic means is necessary to keep alive a functional democracy that provides space for dissent, opposition, struggle, and resistance.

Friends, we cannot afford to remain neutral, when our nation is in crisis. We cannot remain ashore, when the values of our freedom struggle is under attack. We cannot remain silent, when our constitution and our democracy is being dismantled. Today, the time has come to redeem our pledge. To stand together against the assault on democracy. To unite against the dismantling of our constitution. To fight against the hatred and oppression.

Friends, **the time has come to renew our pledge,**

WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:

JUSTICE, social, economic and political;

LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;

EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all

FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;

IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of January, 2024, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.

https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2024/04/27/an-injudicious-judicial-opinion/

>Paragraph 5 of Justice Dipankar Datta’s concurring opinion in the Supreme Court’s 26th April judgment on the question of electronic voting machines [EVMs] and VVPAT verification (Association for Democratic Reforms vs Election Commission of India) proceeds as follows:

>>It is of immediate relevance to note that in recent years, a trend has been fast developing of certain vested interest groups endeavouring to undermine the achievements and accomplishments of the nation, earned through the hard work and dedication of its sincere workforce. There seems to be a concerted effort to discredit, diminish, and weaken the progress of this great nation on every possible frontier. Any such effort, or rather attempt, has to be nipped in the bud. No Constitutional court, far less this Court, would allow such attempt to succeed as long as it (the court) has a say in the matter. I have serious doubt as regards the bona fides of the petitioning association when it seeks a reversion to the old order.

>There are two things to note about this paragraph.

>First, the judge levels a range of allegations in the first two sentences, but provides no evidence or particulars. He does not identify who these “vested interest groups” are. He does not specify what “the achievements and accomplishments of the nation” are, which are being “undermined” by these unnamed “vested interest groups.” He does not clarify what the “concerted effort” is that is being made by (presumably) the same unnamed “vested interest groups.” He does not explain what “progress of this great nation” is being weakened, and how, and by whom. There is a term for such language, and it is called a “dog-whistle.”

>The second issue in this paragraph is the judge’s gratuitous personal attack upon the petitioner, the Association for Democratic Reforms. I will not here write a screed defending the ADR: their two-and-a-half-decades’ worth of work is in the public domain, it speaks for itself, and they do not need anyone to speak on their behalf. Notice, however, how – much like the first part of the paragraph – the judge provides no evidence for doubting ADR’s bona fides; in fact, the only reason for that, that comes out of the judgment, seems to be the judge’s outrage at the suggestion of replacing EVMs with paper ballots",108,0.96,6,https://lawchakra.in/controversial-tweet-bhushan-accuses-judge/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabvGiNCHLrCw40dZCHSC4PEV1WPQu4Dt3CGhsqlxtRIsD-gX3P7m7S8FR8_aem_Aad5NQdfquAS0d1LJxP8wMxLlAsx_Im2yx2-AQQCsXdKjAJvkrkPISlGTynHRX1o84L9GuB3-Bayj2699h5h9eyY,PharmaceuticalSci,2024-04-29 07:16:48
1cz7ejg,India,voting 2024,Prashant Kishore is more than what he seems on the surface…,"With another recent Karan Thapar's ""jal lijiye"" moment, pk is being trolled left and right, for which he should be honestly. He lost his cool in a pretty cringe way, and even though I believe that Karan was purposefully baiting him throughout the interview to re-emphasize the same point about BJP winning majority and questioning his confidence and credibility. PK should have the grace to handle a man like Karan as he has done numerous times in previous interviews with Karan. 



As for the ""prediction"" shown on the screen of Prashant tweet was exaggerated as his tweet said. 


*“I’ve been repeatedly asked to comment on the outcome of #UdaipurChintanShivir In my view, it failed to achieve anything meaningful other than prolonging the status-quo and giving some time to the #Congress leadership, at least till the impending electoral rout in Gujarat and HP!”*


He is telling his opinion about the impact of Congress status-quo leadership though #UdaipurChintanShivir which was in Rajasthan, and will result only in “electoral rout” in Gujrat and HP, Congress lost Gujrat which Karan didn’t highlight, and pk didn’t gave any numbers like he gave in West Bengal 2021 and for BJP 2024, also, INC won HP with 1% greater vote, so the margin was very close (INC=44.2% & BJP=43.2%).


Also, I didn’t find pk’s prediction for BRS Telangana anywhere as Karan mentioned. Still, pk was technically wrong and should’ve handled it better.


##So why I am making this post? Because I noticed people weren’t only trolling him for losing his cool, but people were labelling him a BJP agent and sent by BJP and what not.


If you look at PK’s history, He is the most anti-BJP person you can find, because he may not have criticised them as an influencer on their optics, but he has run against BJP in every election after he ran Modi’s campaign in 2012 & 2014, when asked why he left, he said PM was not interested of his proposals to introduce lateral entry in political post, as he claimed most revolution in India has been possible by bringing people of speciality into the cabinet be it, Green revolution, telecom revolution etc.



He made JDU win Bihar **defeating BJP** in 2015

He made Congress win Punjab **defeating BJP/AAP** in 2017

He **lost Congress** in UP against BJP in 2017 (his only lost)

He made YCP win Andhra **against TDP/BJP** in 2019

He made AAP win Delhi **against BJP** in 2020

He made TMC win Bengal **against BJP** in 2021

He made Stalin win Tamil Nadu against AIADMK in 2019



Now, you can say its business and he is doing it to earn money, how such a money driven person be a good person? And you may be right, he is doing it for himself, whatever his personal reasons be, but he is definitely not cosy to BJP.


Hell, he even pointed the 4 pillars of BJP’s dominance are **Hindutva, Nationalism, Welfare & organisational force**. If Congress can challenge them or give a counter to even 3 of these, BJP will lose. He said that Modi is BJP’s Star, but also their biggest weakness.


Because even though people vote Modi in Lok Sabha, **Modi’s ability to garner voter on this name for regional Vidhan Sabha is declining rapidly since 2019**. So, people are not voting BJP in Vidhan Sabha on Modi’s name only anymore.


He also said Brand Modi is declining as well, because even *their supporters are not mesmerized by him anymore, they will vote for him this time, but only because they think there’s no alternative.*


He also said the level of resistance against BJP will rise in the 3rd term, because **BJP is ignoring the rural distress, unemployment & economic issues**  by the poor people as their income is not increased in this tenure.


Tell me any other BJP agent who has the balls or clarity to say this about BJP.




##He was one of the most vocal critics of CAA-NRC

When he joined JD(U) after 2017, under Nitish Kumar, which later alliance with BJP, he resisted, as he was against BJP’s tactics of doing work after 2014, but he stayed for time because he wanted to develop Bihar, He had three goals in mind.


1.  Thousands of *youths* should enter politics, as the median age of Lok Sabha has been increasing and increasing, he wanted to train young people who wanted some guidance and help them understand the nitty gritty of it.

2.  He wanted *lateral entry* of experts in positions which require it. So that we can get more innovative and creative ways to grow our sectors, he gave examples of the green revolution, telecom revolution, etc.


3.  There should be *decentralisation of power.* From centre to state and state to local. He believes right now, resources are controlled too much by the people above and although it would take years, it still is a necessity.


**Now to CAA-NRC**, He was very vocal that even though CAA maybe alright, NRC will create a divide in society based on religion that shouldn’t exist in our country. He made multiple tweets begging non-BJP states to reject this bill.


He shouted in interviews that BJP can’t strongarm non-BJP states, if they decided to reject it, he was confident that Bihar will never accept it.


But Nitish Kumar voted for it the Parliament, this made PK leave JDU, as he was wholly disappointed with Nitish and his decision.



##What’s his ideology, what he believes in then?

If you scour his interviews, whenever he has been asked this question, he says that he is a believer of Gandhi. He quotes him frequently and has a banner of it on his twitter profile ""The best politics is the right action”.


His ideology lies with the Congress, centre left. He believes in the wisdom of crowds, that people are smart enough and will tell you what they want, if you listen to them carefully without thinking they are poor hence lack intelligence. **He believes India will always have an Opposition as only 38% Hindus voted for the BJP, hence 62% people are still not satisfied with the Hindutva narrative, so half Hindus still not believe Modi’s appeal, implying Hope for the future of this country.** Even though Democratic values have taken a hit under Modi as had under Indira, he believes no single person can steamroll a population of 1.4 billion, unless they have more than 55% of the voter share.


He was a public heath care manager working for UN in Chad, (I know), Africa. For 10 years before his election journey, so he already has plenty of experience in public intervention and data analysis. In fact, he met Modi for a paper he wrote on the child malnutrition epidemic in Gujrat.




##Now, why us liberals felt so strongly about his remarks on BJP?

Since the beginning of this year, we were certain that BJP is winning with a clear majority, even though INDIA had some fuel, we were pretty sure who’ll win. But some things happen that changed the wave, electoral bonds put BJP on the back foot for the first time, even though only narratively. We started believing that maybe it’ll help, then ED arrested Kejriwal, this was also very bad for BJP. So, we saw aha, then low voter turnout, Modi’s Mangal sutra, ECI’s sleepiness, Dhruv Rathee’s explosive series unmasking all the propaganda, and positive feedback from the culture were taken as a at least we are winning culturally, so every mishap by BJP we thought, yes it’ll decrease votes or increase INDIA’s chances, this was 
our resistance.


 but we made a mistake.


We assumed that if INDIA won culturally, it WIILL transform electorally, but the reality is, **it takes months to reach the masses and that’s what Prashant Kishore exposed.** He himself said Modi’s Brand is decreasing, but it won’t really matter electorally as its too little too late.


So, when he said it publicly it felt like all our efforts to resist the dictatorship were in vain. That’s why we started questioning his intentions & motives, as he isn’t criticizing BJP’s horrendous politics, but rather beating an already dead horse like the opposition, which needs are support. That’s what caused pain, I was also depressed, but deep down I think he’s right.



Because he is not saying these things after Electoral Bonds or Kejriwal arrest or low voter turnout to build BJP’s momentum. He has been saying this for the last three months, since January. He maybe wrong or right, but his assessment is consistent, hence worthy to consider. And we liberals should at least, take his word seriously, as he is not just another mouthpiece for ‘saheb’, but one on the finest minds to enter politics in our time. 

My 2 cents.

I didn’t even mention his Jan suraaj moment, where he is doing pad yatra for the last 2 years in every village of Bihar and preaching the values of “vote for the future of your child nor Caste”, “Vote of education” and self-governance. He claims to take Bihar from the least developed state to the Top 10 in the next 10 years.",12,0.6,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1cz7ejg/prashant_kishore_is_more_than_what_he_seems_on/,mzt_101,2024-05-23 23:53:39
1czfpe7,India,voting 2024,"#VoterPrivacyWatch | We’ve been tracking how political parties use mobile apps to identify & profile voters, potentially compromising their data privacy for a range of political gains. Here’s a rundown of some such apps we’ve come across & the risks they pose. ","**1️⃣ BJP’s NaMo App**

The app uses a range of permissions, trackers, & user data to send customised party updates (eg. using location to notify users when the PM is in their state). It’s been under fire for problematic data practices & potential voter profiling concerns. 

NaMo app’s default permission settings gives it nearly full access to the data stored on users’ phones, including photos & videos, contacts, location services, & the ability to record audio. One can opt out by disabling the permissions for those features—but not many may end up doing so.

There is also an institutional push for the app—state govts, mobile phone companies, & even govt-funded schools—have been bundling, pre-installing, or enforcing the NaMo app through their products & schemes.

**2️⃣  TDP’s WeApp**

The YSR Congress Party recently lodged a complaint with ECI alleging that TDP was using its new WeApp to profile voters & bribe them for votes through UPI transfers.

[https://www.boomlive.in/decode/ysrcp-accuses-tdp-voter-profiling-bribery-weapp-voter-data-scandal-andhra-pradesh-eci-elections-2024-25339](https://www.boomlive.in/decode/ysrcp-accuses-tdp-voter-profiling-bribery-weapp-voter-data-scandal-andhra-pradesh-eci-elections-2024-25339) 

Limited publicly available information suggests that WeApp collects detailed data on voters (dead or alive) at the booth level–on family & residence, contact, occupation, caste, political leanings. WeApp is not on app stores & is distributed locally through TDP volunteers. 🥶 

**3️⃣BJP’s Saral App**

BJP uses the ‘Sangathan Reporting & Analysis’ app to directly engage w voters, collecting user photo, contact, address, age, gender, religion, social category like tribe & caste, constituency, voter identity no., professional & educational details... phew.

Saral’s privacy policy further allows it to collect detailed device & location information—experts worry that the scale & depth of this data collection exercise may allow BJP to successfully target & appeal to voters at a granular level. 

[https://restofworld.org/2024/bjp-saral-app-data-gathering/](https://restofworld.org/2024/bjp-saral-app-data-gathering/) 

Well, is any of this legal? ECI recently issued an advisory against voter data collection under the guise of ‘surveys’ promising benefits, & classified this as a violation of Section 123(1) (Bribery) of the Representation of the People Act, 1950. 

[https://elections24.eci.gov.in/docs/JYX9Tcz0En.pdf](https://elections24.eci.gov.in/docs/JYX9Tcz0En.pdf) 

But ECI is late to the party, literally. The advisory does not solve for the scale & depth of sensitive personal voter data political parties have amassed over the years, which they are now using for political gains. 

Watch the space for IFF’s deepdive on these apps & the law.

1cpmxol,India,voting 2024,Is the prolonged election season helping BJP or the Opposition?,"In my opinion, the extended election season seems to be aiding the Opposition in consolidating their efforts. 

Last year, following the formation of the INDIA alliance, the Congress hesitated to actively push the alliance forward, hoping for better seat negotiation post-elections in states like Telangana, Rajasthan, MP, and Chattisgarh. However, this strategy was risky, potentially painting the perception of the alliance as non-serious and non-committed just like the alliance came together for 2019 elections, post which they had no consolidated efforts (like they should have started this alliance in 2021/22 , Since everyone knew there are going to be Lok Sabha elections in 2024)

Had they pursued seat sharing and their common minimum agenda vigorously, it could have allowed their message to reach the grassroots effectively. Nevertheless, dwelling on past choices serves no purpose now.

The current election dynamics seem to favor the opposition, particularly Congress and its allies, whose target demographics mainly include rural residents, the poor, farmers, and unemployed youth. Their proposed policies like reservations, MSP, and DBT are tailored to appeal to these segments. 

Meanwhile, BJP tends to fare better in urban areas among the salaried, middle class, and rich, who may be less inclined towards measures like reservation cap removal, “Freebies or welfare whatever you call it” and wealth redistribution *(even if you assume everything for a minute they are going to snatch your private wealth and give it to the poor as opposed to giving more of govt revenue income to poor via schemes which is what all top leaders of congress have categorically said and clarified - no im not defending them )*

Congress itself knows that it is going to cost them urban votes but these section of people traditionally voted majorly for BJP, so its a calculated move to woo the rural and poor voters at the cost of urban votes.

So the extended election season IMO is actually helping the INDIA alliance to do more rallies and give more time for their proposals and messages to percolate down in scattered, diverse and vast rural areas

And finally whats the projected scoreboard according to you at the end of phase 3?

In cricket terms, will this match be down to the last over and last ball or even superover (hung assembly and then post poll alliances) or will it be a easy win with good Net Run Rate for the NDA?

1cbpi9e,India,voting 2024, Congress's 2024 Apprenticeship Program is very Revolutionary : Details inside,"The Indian National Congress has recently unveiled an apprenticeship program in their 2024 manifesto, a move that promises substantial implications for the Indian workforce and economy. Here's a detailed analysis of how this program could potentially transform India's socio-economic landscape: 

**1. Leveraging the Population Dividend:**  
India is at a critical juncture with its large young population, often referred to as the ""population dividend."" This demographic advantage can be a powerful growth engine but only if adequately harnessed. The proposed apprenticeship program aims to convert this demographic boon into a productive workforce by providing hands-on training and skills development. By doing so, the initiative not only prepares the youth for domestic job markets but also for global opportunities, thereby amplifying their employment prospects and contributing to economic growth. IF WE DON'T USE THIS POPULATION DIVIDEND, IT WILL ONLY END UP BEING POPULATION DEBT. 

[Remember, below age of 25, half of the population is unemployed.](https://preview.redd.it/dv4hn4lptcwc1.jpg?width=1221&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9be1b21408b2daa7f22b99a9d1516dc45f67f38)

Check the picture above, imagine having half of your young blood wasted during these precious years.

**2. Reduction in Future Unemployment:**  
One of the persistent challenges in the Indian job market has been the mismatch between the skills held by the workforce and those demanded by employers. The apprenticeship program directly addresses this by aligning training with real-world business requirements. Apprentices gain practical experience and relevant skills in their chosen fields, which can significantly enhance their employability. This targeted skill development is expected to lower unemployment rates over time, particularly among the youth.

[Modi has failed our nation and our Youth. ](https://preview.redd.it/dj07grxqucwc1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=de5f401aade501a179a50946f489796ac9ad5b68)

  
**3. Boosting Economic Growth Through Skill Enhancement:**  
Enhanced skills lead to higher productivity, which is a direct contributor to economic growth. Apprentices who exit these programs are not just workers; they are skilled professionals capable of contributing more effectively to their employers' output. This increase in productivity can lead to higher wages and better job satisfaction, which in turn fuels consumption and economic growth through increased spending.



**4. Encouraging Entrepreneurship and Innovation:**  
Apprenticeships provide a unique ecosystem where individuals can learn not only the specifics of a job but also the nuances of industry operations. This exposure can foster innovation and encourage some to start their own businesses, thereby promoting entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial ventures can create new jobs and contribute to economic diversification. Way better than having all these people sit around and do nothing.

**5. Impact on Informal Sector:**  
A significant portion of India's workforce is employed in the informal sector, often without any formal job training or security. The apprenticeship program can serve as a bridge for informal sector workers to transition into the formal economy, equipping them with necessary skills and potentially leading to better job security and working conditions.



Now I know most of the people on r/india are privileged and they might not understand the monumentality of this idea.  I know most of you just get internships easy (Not all of you, but many of you) and then dream of going to United States. But rest of the population have none of these privileges to dream even 1% of that. These provisions will bring a huge opportunity for them to have a significant opportunity of upward social mobility.

## [Help us watch the watchmen, donate now!](https://static.internetfreedom.in/donate)

## tl;dr

Last week, the Ministry of  Electronics & Information Technology used a government-run account  to send a WhatsApp message to millions of users, purportedly seeking  feedback and suggestions on their governance. Although the ECI has asked  MeitY to discontinue these messages given that the Model Code of  Conduct is in force, users were quick to raise pertinent questions about  government access to such a database, the role of online communication  platforms in facilitating formal government communication, the timing of  the message in the context of the upcoming elections starting in April,  and the regulations (or lack thereof) in place to safeguard our  privacy. In this post, we unravel these questions in depth and document  the actions we have taken in search of some answers. 

## Background

From  March 15, 2024 onwards, millions of WhatsApp users received a message  from a government-run account named ‘Viksit Bharat Sampark’ seeking  feedback and suggestions from Indian citizens on existing welfare  schemes, [adjoined with a letter](https://content.internetfreedom.in/api/files/divco3ywedt9rpe/mzgrh4weafvlkta/letter_from_prime_minister_Qq58AL6naa.pdf?token=&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The letter enumerates reform efforts  brought on by the incumbent government and their plans to “*work to fulfil the resolve of building a Viksit Bharat*”  or ‘advanced India’. This missive was sent by the Ministry of  Electronics & Information Technology (“MeitY”) and undersigned by  the Prime Minister. 

There are a number of concerns and questions  that emerge from this outreach. First, questions about data privacy of  our contact information – where did MeitY secure the contact information  of such a large database of users from? When did it begin using this  information for outreach, arguably without their consent? Is any of this  in line with established data privacy norms? 

Second is the  question of why WhatsApp was chosen as a medium for outreach, and what  roles and responsibilities similar platforms have in context of  political campaigns and elections. Third, we look into how the  soon-to-be-enacted Digital Personal Data Protection Act (“DPDPA”)  affects (or exempts) government actions along this line and what to  expect when it is finally operationalised. Lastly, we look at what this  means in context of the upcoming General Elections. Sent only a few days  ahead of the Election Commission of India (“ECI”) issuing its Model  Code of Conduct (“MCC”), the message may also serve as a vessel for  covert electoral campaigning in a manner that potentially flouts the  MCC.

On a positive note, on March 21, the ECI took note of the  several complaints it received stating that the message was being sent  while the Model Code of Conduct was in force, and [wrote](https://x.com/imsoumyarendra/status/1770725350596587872?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to MeitY, instructing them to discontinue the messages and too send a compliance report at the earliest.

## A peek into MeitY’s contact book 

The  first and most important question that emerges from this fiasco is –  where did MeitY get my number from? It is not clear what database (one,  or many?) MeitY has relied on to send out the broadcast, further made  confusing by the fact that [individuals](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/did-you-get-pm-modi-viksit-bharat-sampark-whatsapp-letter-people-in-pakistan-dubai-uae-britain-11710777009121.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  from UAE and Pakistan, who are not Indian citizens, have received it  too. This becomes more convoluted when we begin speculating upon the  intent of the government to send out the message merely a few days  before important guidelines on election campaigning over platforms come  into effect (more on this in later sections) – if the intent is  campaigning, why were individuals who are not Indian citizens targeted?  Were there criteria based on which database(s) or recipients were  chosen? What were the criteria?

Further, it may be the case that  MeitY has obtained the database from another agency/authority, either  public or private, but that raises doubts about the lawfulness of how it  was obtained, or whether privacy norms (such as the obligation to take  specific and informed consent before processing or using personal data  for a purpose other than the purpose originally consented to) were  followed. 

We have asked the ministry to clarify these doubts through an [RTI request](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5wYAOc7EHaPpgGkh5prdyrz4oegJX--/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in),  where we seek information on, among other things, the source of contact  information, total number of messages sent, and costs incurred:  


https://preview.redd.it/2r3utrgy5vpc1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=be8627ef4dd0ea53db07b42b39ae72312adbebe7

 

## But we have a data protection law, right? RIGHT?

It  is worth remembering that the government holds access to this extensive  database (one, or many) in the absence of an operational data  protection law. The DPDPA, 2023 is not in operation yet, but even when  it gets enacted and its procedural rules notified, it may still not be  able to adequately regulate data storage and sharing by the government.  Simply because Section 17 of the Act holds the power to exempt  government and other public authorities from its very application at any  given time. Read more about how the DPDPA fails to safeguard our  privacy [here](https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-first-read-of-the-draft-digital-personal-data-protection-bill-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

## A government DM on WhatsApp was not on my 2024 bingo card

While  we are accustomed to receiving messages from the government through our  telecom service providers, communication through an online  communication platform has caught us off guard – making us question what  statute/ law exactly allows this. WhatsApp’s Business Messaging Policy  clearly states that a business account may only contact people on  WhatsApp if: “*(a) they have given you their mobile phone number; and  (b) you have received opt-in permission from the recipient confirming  that they wish to receive subsequent messages from you on WhatsApp*”.  WhatsApp emphasises on the need to have informed consent of the users  receiving the message and clear communication regarding the opt-in  choice of the user. It also suggests best practices to create a  high-quality opt-in experience:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gjpeqa316vpc1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=346558dc768123636fb84c49a4f08b7c4f1ba7ea

 

Disappointingly, the message sent by the government does not declare  how and when, if at all, users shared their mobile numbers and gave  their consent/ opted-in to being contacted on WhatsApp. The policy also  states that the business account is “*responsible for and must secure  all necessary notices, permissions, and consents to collect, use, and  share people's content and information, including maintaining a  published privacy policy, and otherwise complying with applicable law*.” Since the DPDPA, 2023 is not yet operational, its provisions and limited safeguards will not apply to the government.

Clause  7 of the DPDPA, 2023 allows the Data Fiduciary to not obtain the  informed consent of the Data Principal and assume the consent if the  processing was considered necessary as per certain situations. It is  worth noting that the DPDPA, 2023 varied from its 2022 iteration as it  omitted  “public interest” as one of the situations wherein consent may  be deemed and data processed non-consensually. This was a positive  development since the 2022 iteration failed to strictly define the  situations in which it may be invoked and thus, could have been widely  interpreted leading to misuse. Notably, Clause 7(b) gives state  instrumentalities a concerning amount of liberty to process the personal  data of data principals if the latter has previously consented to its  processing or if such data is maintained by any instrumentality of the  State. However, at the moment we are unable to decipher if such  unsolicited and non-consensual outreach from the government would have  been a violation of Clause 7 of the Act, since it is not yet in  operation.

## Outreach right before the elections? The timing is sus

The  message, broadcast to millions of people through WhatsApp, may be  viewed in the context of the upcoming elections as the communication  happened around the time the [Model Code of Conduct](https://www.eci.gov.in/mcc/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) went into effect. [Reports](https://www.jagran.com/politics/national-pm-modi-letter-before-lok-sabha-election-2024-announcement-pm-modi-message-to-country-23675949.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of the message being received by individuals surfaced as early as March 16, the same day the ECI [announced](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/model-code-of-conduct-to-come-into-force-soon-after-eci-announces-election-schedule/article67955521.ece?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  the election dates. The MCC prohibits the party in power from the  misuse of official mass media during the election period for partisan  coverage of political news and publicity regarding achievements. The  ECI, through the MCC, also [prohibits](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/whats-model-code-of-conduct-how-it-came-into-being-and-whats-allowed-and-whats-not/articleshow/108545901.cms?from=mdr&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  the issuance of advertisements at the cost of the public exchequer in  newspapers and other media during the election period. This may lead us  to question - Does the timing of the communication, which happened  around the time the election dates were announced and the MCC went into  effect, have potential electoral implications? 

On March 21, 2024,  the ECI wrote to MeitY, asking them to discontinue delivery of the  messages on WhatsApp. As per the letter, the ECI received several  complaints from individuals about getting the message from MeitY during  the MCC period. The letter also notes that although the Ministry sent  out the messages on March 15, the system architecture and network  limitations of the communication platform chosen by the government  delayed the delivery. The ECI also asked MeitY to send a compliance  report at the earliest. We appreciate the ECI for taking note of the  complaints, enforcing the MCC, and instructing MeitY to discontinue the  messages.   


([https://twitter.com/Aditi\_muses/status/1770725612514169215](https://twitter.com/Aditi_muses/status/1770725612514169215))  


However, we also note that this kind of communication by MeitY is not new, especially with the general elections less than a month away. In  the months leading up to elections, electoral candidates and political  parties make large investments in campaigns, rallies, outreach, and  other modes with which they can reach voters and influence popular vote.  A prevalent way of doing this is targeted outreach or ‘[votebank politics](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/opinion-vote-bank-politics-is-not-always-bad-for-democracy-1554661359793.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)’,  where parties can appeal to certain socio-economic groups specifically  by outlining the kind of welfare they can bring to the groups. 

In  recent years, parties have resorted to questionable means of collecting  demographic data for the purposes of targeted campaigning. By tapping  into government databases and accessing beneficiary information across  schemes, or by means of online ‘surveys’ and mobile apps, parties are  able to extract a lot of personal information about voters and create  360° profiles to run extremely targeted campaigns. [This video](https://shivamsingh.in/index.php/portfolio/fifthel-weaponizing-data-for-politics/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  by Shivam Shankar Singh titled ‘Weaponising Data for Politics’,  explains how precisely parties are able to draw voter profiles from data  accessed by dubious means. We are working on a detailed explainer on  how this is done, and the privacy concerns emerging from the practice.  Meanwhile, we hope the ECI keeps their momentum going after this  incident, and engages more meaningfully on how political parties access  personal data.

## What has IFF done about it? 

Much  like several concerned people on the internet, we too have questions  about this outreach. In the hopes for some answers, we have filed the  above mentioned [RTI application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5wYAOc7EHaPpgGkh5prdyrz4oegJX--/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in). We have recently also published a [short video](https://x.com/internetfreedom/status/1770317430612447266?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  summarising concerns and efforts. We are additionally exploring all  avenues, including potential legal challenges to the inadequate DPDPA,  2023 pushing for a rights-respecting data protection framework.

***Important information-***

Every vote matters! In General Elections of 2019, in UP's Machhlishahr constituency, a BSP candidate Tribhuvan Ram lost elections to opponent BJP Candidate Bholanath by JUST ***181 votes***. See here- [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-constituencies/uttar-pradesh/machhlishahr/](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-constituencies/uttar-pradesh/machhlishahr/)

NOTA(None of the above) option on EVMs is completely useless when it comes to Indian elections. If majority votes go to NOTA, there is no change in election result and the next candidate with maximum votes will automatically win. So choosing NOTA is as good as not going to vote and your vote gets wasted.

The information in above links, can incomplete. For example I couldn't find Kangana ji's affidavit for Himachal Pradesh's Mandi constituency on ECI website, but information about Gujarat seems to be complete. But was able to find Arun Govil's name in UP's Meerut. 

Please post any other queries or useful information in comments, and I will update this post or repost accordingly. Please also share this information with as many people as possible.

I personally request- Our right to choose who runs this country using out vote is what our ancestors fought for and died for. So please exercise this right. Safe and happy voting!

Exit polls been released after the conclusion of one of the most controversial general election in India. Most of the polls have given a huge majority to the BJP-led NDA. This has provoked widespread concern among the common people. I have received dozens of messages and calls from friends expressing a sense of uncertainty about what the future may hold for India. These anxieties are not misplaced.

The two terms of BJP saw growing authoritarianism and communalism. Institutions were compromised and turned into a political weapon. Activists, journalists, academicians, and dissenters were persecuted and imprisoned. Protests were crushed by force. Education system was slowly saffronised. Media was turned into a propaganda arm of the Government, which buried issues of public interest. Hate speeches and violence against minorities was normalized. Religious festivals were captured by a political mob. Parliament was forcibly captured, disallowing the opposition to speak. Federalism was slowly eroded. With draconian laws, Modi Government had virtually created a Police Raj in India. The nation was already moving towards a fascist state.

Meanwhile, as the country went to elections, BJP embarked on a campaign of communalism and hate. The model code of conduct was torn to shreds, while the election commission refused to take any action against BJP leaders, despite repeated complaints. Opposition candidates were intimidated to withdraw their nomination. Media was used to run an open propaganda for the ruling party. Religion was openly used for election campaign.

In the meantime, despite insurmountable odds, we did try our best to prevent the return of the BJP. Tens of thousands of people, young and old, tirelessly campaigned for months. Many people made huge sacrifices to give us a glimmer of hope, a small chance at victory. I wrote dozens of articles, documents, urging people to rise up and fight against the fascism.

In all honesty, I do not believe that the exit polls are right. And, that the BJP may remain much below 272. There has been widespread disenchantment and anger against the BJP Government. People raised the issues of livelihood, like unemployment and price rise, as well as rise of authoritarianism and assault on constitution. Many local protests were observed as well.  However, if the predictions of the exit polls does come indeed true, we must recognize, that we will have to face dark times ahead. 

If, after June 4, Modi Government returns to power, country will inevitably regress into a full-blown fascism. The activists and journalists who speak against the regime will be put in jail. All the facts and data will be suppressed. Media will further deteriorate into a pure and ugly propaganda, that will target common citizens and sing praises for our non-biological Prime Minister. Broadcast Regulations bill, and various suppression will ensure that even social media will not be available as a source of information. Violence and hate-speeches will become a norm. Opposition will be crushed. Most importantly, as Dr Parakala Prabhakar warned,

> Do not expect further elections in India, the Constitution will be changed. The hate speeches and calls for violence that you are hearing in rallies and Dharam Sansads, will be heard from Red Fort.

This is not scaremongering or pessimism, but an imminent and inevitable truth.

The first casualty will, however, be our right to protest. A people's movement is the greatest thorn in Modi's side, one that will be outlawed at the earliest.

[Right to Protest. An important appeal. Please read. : india](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/kdl5hv/right_to_protest_an_important_appeal_please_read/)

The question that remains before us, is what needs to be done now. In an earlier article, written on the Desecration of the Indian Republic, I had pondered the same. And, for all my friends and colleagues who are concerned, my answer still remains the same. We will fight against tyranny and injustice with our last drop of blood.  We will again rebuild our movements. We will defend the rights of the marginalised, the minorities, the poor. We will not be the generation that lost our freedom without a fight.

1d3kc41,India,voting 2024,Saluting the Heroes of Democracy,"Dear Citizens of India,

As we come together to celebrate the world’s largest democratic election, we are reminded of the strength and vibrancy of our great nation. This monumental task, the General Election of 2024, is a testament to the spirit of democracy that lives in each one of us.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Election Commission and its workers and volunteers who have spanned the entire Indian terrain to ensure that every vote counts. From the heights of the Himalayas to the vast plains, from the scorching deserts of Rajasthan to the dense jungles and remote islands, your dedication and resilience have made this election possible.

To all the employees, volunteers, police officers, booth agents, and polling agents who have worked tirelessly, we owe a debt of gratitude. Your efforts have ensured that every citizen's voice is heard and every vote is counted.

We also thank the voters who braved the high summer temperatures to participate in this democratic process. Your commitment to exercising your right to vote is a testament to the strength of our democracy.

Let us show our appreciation and solidarity by stepping out of our homes at 6 PM on 4th June 2024 to clap and ring bells in honor of these unsung heroes. Your efforts are the backbone of our democracy, and we salute you!

Thank you for your unwavering commitment to upholding the values of our democracy. Together, we make India shine brighter.

## tl;dr

The rapid advancement of generative AI technology is reshaping the political landscape, presenting both [challenges](https://www.livemint.com/elections/indian-political-parties-bjp-congress-embrace-deepfakes-for-2024-lok-sabha-election-campaigns-11708515899523.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and [opportunities](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/2/12/how-ai-is-used-to-resurrect-dead-indian-politicians-as-elections-loom?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  for the 2024 Indian election. Given that instances of creation, use,  and dissemination of AI-generated synthetic media have surfaced in the [recent past](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/20/deepfake-democracy-behind-the-ai-trickery-shaping-indias-2024-elections?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), both domestically and [internationally](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/23/ai-deepfakes-come-of-age-as-billions-prepare-to-vote-in-a-bumper-year-of-elections?ref=static.internetfreedom.in),  we request all Indian political candidates and affiliated organisations  to publicly commit not to use deepfakes technology to create deceptive  or misleading synthetic content in the run-up to and during the 2024  general elections. 

## Why should you care?

Elections  are the cornerstone of any democracy, and the legitimate and  responsible use of technology can empower citizens in a way that  harnesses the true potential of elections. The ethical use of technology  has certainly served to increase electoral legitimacy, curb  malpractices, and broaden outreach. However, the negative affordances of  technology have the potential to create disruptions in the functioning  of a fair and ethical election. 

Advancements in technology have  led to the emergence of sophisticated and complex systems that can  deceptively alter the flow of information in digital and physical  spaces. One such evolving and emerging technology is deepfakes – digital  content that has been manipulated or synthesised using deep learning  models to appear authentic – which may be circulated through various  forms of media. Given the low rates of media and information literacy as  well as the divisive politics in the country, the severity of threats  posed by synthetic media must be acknowledged at the earliest.

## Our demands

Instances  of creation, use, and dissemination of such AI-generated synthetic  media have been increasing in the country, with use cases ranging from  language translation to financial fraud (see [here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgedjb/the-first-use-of-deepfakes-in-indian-election-by-bjp?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [here](https://theprint.in/india/celeb-deepfakes-just-the-tip-revenge-porn-fraud-threat-to-polls-form-underbelly-of-ai-misuse/1841666/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), and [here](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-among-top-targets-of-deepfake-identity-fraud-2472241-2023-12-05?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)).  Although the positive affordances of such a technology are several, the  consequences of its misuse, especially in the election context, may be  grave. While much of the focus of the incumbent government is on  reiterating the obligations of platforms and identifying regulatory  avenues to curb the spread of such content on social media platforms,  there is also a pressing need to interrogate the use of deepfakes  technology by political actors with the intent to impact electoral  outcomes. 

Although more broad-based research is required to  establish that the circulation of synthetic media directly affects  voting patterns, the use of deepfakes for disseminating misleading or  deceptive narratives about political candidates and affiliated  institutions may affect voter perspectives, sentiments, as well as their  behaviour. Targeted misuse of the technology against candidates,  journalists, and other actors who belong to gender minorities, may  further deepen inequities in the election. Such methods, if widely  employed, even have the potential to impact electoral outcomes, thus  painting a concerning picture for electoral integrity. 

Over the  years, political parties have been able to establish sophisticated  channels for information dissemination and campaigning, which can be  used for the widespread circulation of manipulated media among voters.  The ability to derail or discredit another candidate’s campaign or to  even make false and fictitious claims to bolster one’s campaign existed  in previous elections. However, the ability to do that in the upcoming  elections with such generative technology, that is also readily and  freely available to everyone, may have drastic implications on a large  scale – such as voters being deliberately misinformed, affecting their  ability to exercise their democratic right to cast a free and informed  vote. 

Given that instances of such misuse have surfaced in the recent past, both domestically and internationally, **we request all political candidates and affiliated organisations to publicly commit not to use deepfakes technology to create deceptive or misleading synthetic content in the run-up to and during the 2024 general elections** (see [here](https://www.boomlive.in/decode/how-ai-generated-images-took-centre-stage-in-telangana-elections-24076?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and [here](https://www.boomlive.in/decode/deepfake-elections-disinformation-bangladesh-india-us-uk-indonesia-24087?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)).  We urge political representatives to oppose the use of such  disinformation campaigns before elections and request them to be aware  and take action against the physical circulation of synthetic content.

19f7fgn,India,voting 2024,"""Digital Nagriks"" for a Free, Equal, and Inclusive Internet: Our demands from the incoming Union Government","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i3pz3sxepkec1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d0a87c76d573a2698e8720812fa156589a3af8f

The 2024 general elections to elect Lok Sabha members are slated to be an event of grandeur. With [over 900 million Indian voters](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/world/story/the-year-of-elections-4-billion-people-will-cast-a-vote-in-over-60-countries-in-2024-412123-2024-01-06?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  geared up to vote a new Union government to power, the focus will soon  shift to promises, development agendas, and governance priorities of  political parties in the running. In that context, IFF has attempted to  list out a [seven-point agenda](https://content.internetfreedom.in/api/files/divco3ywedt9rpe/djl2zc6j7ukmb4q/digital_rights_manifesto_2024_7rxzqKH0Hg.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on  technology and human rights that can be adopted by electoral candidates  and political parties in their party manifestos for the 2024 general  and state elections. 

More Indians are online today than ever before. A [Hindu report](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/over-50-indians-are-active-internet-users-now-base-to-reach-900-million-by-2025-report/article66809522.ece?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  from May 2023 speculates that half the Indian population now has access  to the internet. At the outset, the numbers paint a positive picture –  the country’s digital divide, a gaping problem that alienates many  groups from reaping the benefits of digital technologies recreationally  as well as for better quality of life, is seemingly being bridged. The  increasing adoption of the internet also signals a continuing belief  that it has the potential to make our lives better. But on a closer  look, we see that the internet is also being wielded as a tool of  arbitrary executive control by our government, which deepens the divide  and excludes vulnerable communities. Instances of indefinite and  disproportionate internet shutdowns, threats to net neutrality,  tech-enabled gender violence – all indicate that while Indians are  online, our engagement with the internet is not necessarily meaningful  or fructuous. A free, equal and inclusive internet  can only be ensured  when the rights of users are written into the law, and our institutions  invest their time and resources in building rights-affirming, secure and  trustworthy legal mechanisms for us to safely make the most of the  internet. 

Sometimes, we find that our government slips up on this  legitimate expectation. Their interests may misalign with ours – as can  be seen from the wide array of flawed or underdeveloped tech-policy  regulatory developments that have been enacted in the last few years.  But our demands for rights-centric legislation and good governance must  not stop. As ""Digital Nagriks"", a title endowed upon citizens of a  “Digital India” by the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, we  must continue to participate in our democracy and hold our governments  accountable for the protection, preservation, and advancement of our  constitutionally guaranteed digital rights.

We, at IFF, noted the  absence of a clearly articulated message or political charter of demands  surrounding the use of digital technologies in India. This seven-point  agenda has been created to fill that gap. We attempted a similar  exercise in 2019 – where we [presented a set of demands](https://internetfreedom.in/digital-rights-as-a-campaign-priority-as-we-step-toward-the-next-election/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  and reached out to all political parties and candidates to open a  channel of communication. This year, we have streamlined these demands  into seven broad themes of governance. 

### I. Digital rights are human rights

The  incoming government must support and advocate for protecting and  expanding our fundamental human rights in the realm of digital  technologies, with a focus on constitutional principles of justice,  liberty, equality, and fraternity. With growing digitisation and more  Indians coming online, the human rights impact of digital technologies  has become a core governance issue, which must be implemented through  executive and legislative action. The government must apply systemic  solutions to systemic problems such as cybersecurity threats and online  harms, while preserving our security through the adoption of  privacy-protecting technologies. The protection and advancement of the  digital rights of individuals and collectives must become a governance  priority. 

### II. Technology should lead to inclusion and equality

The  incoming government must ensure greater access to the internet and to  digital technologies – access that is physical, educational, monetary,  intersectional, and equitable. Internet penetration must increase in  remote corners of the country to secure the right of every Indian to  communicate, send, and receive information and to bridge the digital  divide. No person should be excluded from government services, benefits,  or entitlements due to the adoption of e-governance services or  digitisation, and the delivery of welfare services must not be impeded  due to technical failures or inaccessibility. The government should  empower those from backgrounds and identities who can use technology for  a better, more productive life across boundaries of religion, caste and  gender. 

### III. Free speech must be respected

The  growing presence of Indians in online spaces reinforces the need to  protect their freedom of speech and expression as well as their right to  receive information online. Reinterpretation or replacement of  antiquated laws must not be employed as a means to suppress dissenting  and vulnerable voices and to solidify disproportionate power with the  Executive. While an online attack on the freedoms and rights of others  must be countered with effective measures, the incoming government must  ensure that legitimate, constitutional rights are protected and  promoted. Neither the government nor the platforms can become sole  arbiters of online free speech, in the absence of judicial safeguards.  The government must oppose the disproportionate, unreasoned, and  non-transparent suspension of the internet. India’s troublesome  performance in globally renowned indexes measuring internet shutdowns  and online speech censorship is a cause for alarm, and the government  must safeguard fundamental and human rights in online domains,  preventing any authoritarian abuse of power.

### IV. Upholding informational privacy

Protection of privacy, as articulated by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in the two *Puttaswamy v. Union of India*  judgments (2017 and 2019), is indispensable to a digital India. To  ensure that the informational privacy of all Indians is protected, the  incoming government must commit to building a rights-affirming digital  environment with adequate channels for grievance redress. The data  protection legislation must be amended to meet the standards of privacy  and principles of proportionality set out by the Supreme Court in the *Puttaswamy* judgments.  The government must implement robust data processing, storage and  sharing mechanisms in line with internationally accepted principles. At  the same time, the right to information and the RTI Act, which is a  significant pillar of democratic governance, must not be diluted.

### V. Checks on surveillance

In  order to preserve the privacy, dignity, and freedom of movement of  Indian citizens, there is a critical need to establish proper safeguards  and oversight over digital surveillance by the Executive. Legal  safeguards and processes with adequate checks and balances must be  created for surveillance by police and intelligence agencies, to prevent  misuse and targeted or mass surveillance of individuals. The incoming  government must introduce long overdue reform in surveillance practices  and powers of the Executive, with sufficient legislative and judicial  oversight on any interception of digital devices, including computer  access and phone tapping. The role of intrusive, emerging technological  use-cases such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition in  surveillance must be closely reevaluated, and privacy impact assessments  conducted before deploying such tools. The government must protect and  encourage the adoption of encryption technologies like end-to-end  encryption, and eliminate the use of spyware as a tool for  surveillance. 

### VI. Making consumer facing digital platforms accountable

India  is a valuable market for companies globally, with Indians forming a  bulk of their user base. In exchange for establishing a presence on and  using the services of these platforms, users are unknowingly  relinquishing effective control over how they interact with technology.  Legislative, regulatory, and policy measures are needed to effectively  ensure an equitable balance of company interests and individual rights,  in a way that the former respects the fundamental right to free speech  and privacy. Technology companies as well as the government must strive  to serve the public’s best interests instead of protecting company  profits. To that end, the incoming government must ensure that companies  adopt measures for greater transparency and accountability through  tools such as a Human Rights Impact Assessment. 

### VII. Ensuring legitimate use of generative AI

The  legitimate use of generative AI for reasons such as translation or  authorised dubbing of audio-video content to reach a broader audience  can achieve positive outcomes. However, the unauthorised use of such  technology for nefarious use to create manipulated media can have  devastating consequences, including financial fraud, defamation,  impersonation, etc. In light of the existing limitations of detection  tools and redressal capabilities of platforms and companies, the  incoming government must commit to not creating and/or using manipulated  media for nefarious reasons as government actors and otherwise. The  government must create solutions at the legal, policy, and societal  levels for such emerging technologies in a way that balances the right  to online free legitimate and legal speech and the right to receive  information. In addition to working towards building technical capacity  within the government and its allied organisations to tackle these  emerging threats, media literacy should be a priority both in the  digital and physical space, to raise awareness about the existence of  and threats posed by these technologies.

1b0ex4k,India,voting 2024,Investors want to both give and not give Byju's more money,"*Original Source:* [*https://boringmoney.in/p/investors-rights-issue-sue-byjus*](https://boringmoney.in/p/investors-rights-issue-sue-byjus?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=investors-rights-issue-sue-byjus)

\--

Sometime mid of last year people got to know of a bunch of financial soups edtech company Byju’s had found itself in. It had been [overstating](https://www.livemint.com/companies/icai-to-flag-concerns-about-byju-s-financials-11691433908297.html) its revenue, its auditor was unhappy and had [resigned](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/byjus-appoints-bdo-mska-associates-as-new-auditors-after-deloitte-quits/article66997825.ece), it was late in filing its financials by two years. \[1\] It had also [defaulted](https://boringmoney.in/p/byjus-definitely-defaulted) on a $1.2 billion loan in the US and had been sued by its lenders who were dead set to recover every last penny from the company.

Basically Byju’s wasn’t doing well financially. And well, most of it was a result of its own doings. Given this situation, if you happen to be a Byju’s board member, it’s not the most pleasant place to be in. In some sense, *you* are responsible. The company fell into this mess on your watch. You were the investors’ representatives and you clearly didn’t do a great job in keeping an eye out for their interests.

But you *might* not be responsible. Byju’s is a company with an assertive, even firebrand founder in Byju Raveendran, and such firebrand founders often receive a free hand from venture capital investors to run their company whatever way they like. Sometimes, the founders deceive their board members.

As a board member, how you go from here depends on what you’re willing to admit. Do you own up to your mistake? The founder may have done all the bad things but ultimately you were responsible. You’ve now got to admit your folly, switch course, even poke your nose in everyday company affairs which you wouldn’t have thought to do earlier. As a board member, you guide the company out of this. You would influence other board members, ratify the decisions you think are good, reject the ones that are bad. Do your job! But you do have to admit that you were responsible. Not easy.

The alternative is that you claim that the founder did stuff that you had absolutely no flipping idea about. You’re not responsible, you’re the victim! In this case, one of the things that might seem reasonable to do is resigning from the board. “Wow the founder really duped me here,” is the message you want to send out.. “On a moral level, I can’t be part of this anymore.”

Three large Byju’s investors—Prosus, Peak XV Partners and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative—who were on the company board [chose the second path](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/more-trouble-for-byjus-as-key-board-members-resign-sources/articleshow/101191922.cms). They resigned from the board last July.

Sure, the board-resigning investors didn’t want their reputation at risk because of the crap Byju’s might have done. But the flip side of resigning from the board is that you no longer have a say in decisions which require board approval. And sometimes you might *really* not like those decisions.

Earlier this month Byju’s announced that it was raising money from existing investors via a rights issue at a 99% drop in valuation. The board-resigners didn’t like it too much. From [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/23/byjus-investors-unanimously-vote-to-remove-founder/):

>A group of Byju’s investors on Friday voted to remove the edtech group’s founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran and separately filed an oppression and management suit against the leadership at the firm to block the recently launched rights issue in a surreal moment for the startup, once India’s most valuable.  
>  
>At an emergency general meeting (EGM) that concluded earlier today, a group of investors including Prosus Ventures and Peak XV Partners voted to change the leadership at the startup. The participating shareholders — whose combined ownership in Byju’s exceeded 60%, according to an investor source familiar with the matter — also passed the resolution to reconstitute Byju’s board. (Two people close to Byju’s disputed that participating shareholders held over 60% ownership in the firm. Neither of the sides have issued an official statement on the figures.)

Byju’s board-resigning investors had stepped down last July but got around to coming together, voting to remove founder and CEO Byju Raveendran from the company only last Friday. They are also suing him in the NCLT. The trigger for all this was the rights issue which they obviously did not like, because, well, it forces them to either invest or get diluted out of the company. \[2\]

Any major fundraise that a company does must get its board’s approval. Byju’s board has three members at the moment—Byju Raveendran, his wife, and his brother. The board-resigners should’ve remained on that board! Maybe they could have stopped the rights issue from happening in the first place.

# An opportunistic trade

One story of the ongoing Byju’s episode, also the story that I’ve touched upon, is that Byju’s investors don’t like Byju Raveendran and want him out. The investors are on one side, Raveendran on the other. Another story though is that while all this is happening, Byju’s seems to have successfully received a [commitment of $200 million](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/20/byjus-says-200-million-rights-issue-that-cuts-valuation-by-99-fully-subscribed/) from existing investors.

From existing investors! So maybe a more accurate framing of the ongoing episode is that some investors are on one side, and Raveendran and some other investors on the other. These other investors want to give him more money.

Byju Raveendran and his family own around [26%](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/byjus-egm-investors-vote-to-remove-founder-from-board-edtech-says-resolutions-invalid/articleshow/107947262.cms?from=mdr) of Byju’s. They’re going to invest in the rights issue (of course). The board-resigners own about [30%](https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/you-just-cant-oust-us-byjus-tells-investors-11706891984267.html#:~:text=On%201%20February%2C-,top%20investors%20holding%20a%20combined%2030%25%20stake,-in%20Byju%E2%80%99s%20parent%20Think%20%26%20Lear). They’re not going to invest in the rights issue (probably). That leaves about 45% of the holding with shareholders who we have no idea about. \[3\]

The way a rights issue works is that investors get a right to buy shares proportionate to their holding. But if certain investors choose not to exercise that right, then other investors can buy shares more than they would have been able to otherwise.

If the board-resigning investors who own 30% aren’t going to invest, then the mysterious 45% investors can chip in extra in their place. But why would any investor want to give the company any more money? Of course, one reason is always that there is an element of sunk cost. When Byju’s raised $250 million in 2022, that’s exactly [what I’d written](https://boringmoney.in/p/byjus-raises-some-money). The investors had already given Byju’s too much money and the stakes were too high to back out then.

But there’s more this time around. This particular instance the valuation is so low that the investors who choose not to invest lose everything. Conversely, the investors who do invest stand to get a lot more bang for their buck.

Here’s what the numbers roughly look like:

1. Byju’s is raising $200 million and its post-money valuation will be $225 million. \[4\]
2. Raveendran & family own 26%. So they’ll have to put in about $50 million (26% of $200m).
3. This leaves $150 million. A large chunk of shareholders (including the board-resigning investors but surely there would be more) would not exercise their rights and would not invest. So the investors that do invest, would have to chip in this $150m.
4. But for this $150 million, they will get 66% of the company. (Going by the company’s $225m valuation.) \[5\]

So, sure, there is a large chunk of investors who desperately want to boot out Raveendran and stall this rights issue. But there is also a chunk of investors (or at least *an* investor) who is looking forward to the large investors sitting out of the rights issue so that they stand the chance to grab a majority stake in the company.

Byju’s is fighting its board-resigning investors in two courts at the moment. In the [Karnataka High Court](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/byjus-investors-meeting-karnataka-high-court-9177079/), to get its investors’ meeting and vote to remove Raveendran from the company invalidated. And in the NCLT, where the investors filed the suit to get Byju’s rights issue invalidated. I don’t know how this is going to end but I do know that the end date of the rights issue is in two days and no court is this fast. It’s unlikely either court decides in time.

So probably the rights issue will happen and the investors who don’t invest get booted out automatically? The funniest outcome would be if the rights issue goes through anyway and the board-resigning investors invest more money even while fighting the company in court. Because the sunk cost is too huge to ignore.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] Indian companies, even the ones that aren’t listed, have to file their financials with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs annually. The timeline isn’t as strict as it is for listed companies, and a lot of companies really skimp out on it, but not usually the prominent ones.

\[2\] Here’s how to think about this. Byju’s is a pie of a certain size. The company first massively reduces the size of this pie. So whatever portion of the pie you owned becomes close to nothing. Now, Byju’s wants to increase the size of this pie again. But this is a fresh pie. If you buy a piece, you’re part of the new pie. If you don’t, you end up holding the minuscule piece of the old pie. In other words, you’re diluted out.

\[3\] Some reports, including the TechCrunch one I linked to earlier in the post, say that 60% of Byju’s shareholders voted to remove Byju Raveendran. Raveendran himself [says](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/byjus-founder-says-he-continues-to-be-ceo-only-45-pc-shareholders-voted-against-him-9179282/) that this figure would have been closer to 45%. The true figure could be anywhere in-between, leaving 15–30% of smaller investors who aren’t accounted for.

\[4\] If a company’s worth $100 but someone gives it $500, the company’s pre-money valuation was $100 but post-money valuation is $600. Because that cash is worth something.

\[5\] The true figure would be this 66% + a part of their earlier stake which would be small and negligible.

1d7qc1r,India,exit polls 2024,Opposition deserves some appreciation...,"Finally after a long time we saw the election which is not completely 'One-Sided' and anything can happen...

For this opposition deserves a bit of praise for the way they planned their campaign and gave equal 'Reaction' to government's 'Action'.

What impressed me the most is how they countered 'Abki baar 400 paar' slogan with 'Consitution in danger ' slogan. Honestly this was the best strategy one can adapt and hats off to strategist 'Sunil Kanugolu ' and other politicians coming up with it

The way MAHARASTRA AND UTTAR PRADESH changed the game, hats off to Sharad pawar, Uddhav thackeray , Akhilesh and all the other politicians. Sharad Pawar impressed me the most by giving one of his best electoral performance. I mean even after his party broke, Guy is leading in 8 out of 10 seats his party is contesting in !!

And last but not least 'Arvind Kejriwal ' set up a pitch brilliantly by exposing BJP's 'loophole' of retiring at 75 years and indirectly pitted Yogi and Shah( two of the powerful politicians considered after Modi) with each other. He even predicted exit poll data is to influence share market which is what exactly happened !

So overall opposition gave a good fight irrespective of who is going to form the government

1d0jf5u,India,exit polls 2024,My thoughts on these 'exit-polls' that we are seeing from popular political analysts and journalists,"Past few days a lot of journalists and political analysts have been giving their predictions for the election results and there have been somewhat contradictory predictions, but they still more or less think that BJP/NDA is going to form the government. The real difference arises when we look at predictions and analysis of 'smaller' journalists (KP Singh, Sheetal Singh etc.) who have much better understanding of what's happening on the ground.

These journalists are painting very grim results for BJP especially in UP and Haryana. Being a sceptic, I kept trying to find some ulterior motives from them but it's hard to think of something. My understanding of caste and religious structure of UP also makes this seems much more logical than any of the famous analysts. Muslims, Dalits, and many backward castes are en masse voting for whoever can defeat BJP and if that really happens then obviously things become difficult for BJP.

BJP also seems extremely desperate which I have not seen happening in last 10 years. There are way too many reports of violence and discrimination against Muslim and Dalit voters to prevent them from voting as much as possible. Some journalists also tell that there have been all sorts of mishaps happening inside the voting booth as we have seen in some of the videos.

Hard to know which reports to believe among all these contradictory reports. My only hope at this point is that the results are as fare as they can be at this point.",14,0.64,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1d0jf5u/my_thoughts_on_these_exitpolls_that_we_are_seeing/,-f-m-l,2024-05-25 19:22:17

Our country is engulfed in a whirlwind of turmoil and uncertainty. Citizens are disillusioned, yet the allure of authority seems to overshadow their discontent. How have we become so indifferent to our democratic ideals? Are we willingly embracing a future devoid of the freedoms we once cherished?

1. Manipur's turmoil is at peak. Still no imposition of President's rule.
2. The Hasdeo protest has received little to no action or media coverage.
3. Several Supreme Court judges have publicly stated that the media, considered the fourth pillar of democracy, has failed.
4. Over 10% of Ladakh's population is currently protesting.
5. The farmer's protest are being labeled Anti-Nationals for demanding the legalization of MSP.
6. Numerous airports and coal tenders have been handed over to the Adani Group.
7. Governors are delaying the approval of state executive bills.
8. Election Commission allowing illegal political campaigns of BJP where your constituency location and bank details are indirectly being asked.
9. Broadcasting Bill is just about ready to be introduced.

Are all these events mere coincidences? Are we turning a blind eye to a larger conspiracy? It's time to wake up and realize that our nation is being influenced right in front of us.

Amazing how People are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure.

No whataboutism please, all these things (minus infra) were far better in were far better in UPA era.

Even if for a moment we give the benefit of doubt to those who support BJP and accept their argument or stance, **whats the guarantee that BJP would continue infrastructure push when they become authoritarian?**

And infra doesn’t mean only roads, airports, ports. It also means clean air, environment, accessible spaces, SMART CITIES (remember?) , etc

And this infrastructure image that BJP has has its own fair share of corruption so BJP Supporters cannot claim they are clean (all are equally dirty in corruption, none spared) , and has its own quality problems, toll prices problems, monopolisation problems. So the reason why BJP came to power in 2014 was riding the India against Corruption movement.. now that differentiating factor of non corrupt vs corrupt has vanished.. whats left?  And something as recent as Electoral bonds, Washing Machine to reinforce this point.

Even if you assume both congress and BJP are equally corrupt and deliver equal economic performance, congress atleast has better social fabric and democratic values. See their manifesto if you haven’t.

Economy? Most of the economic growth is because of the govt spending and we all see the joblessness and unemployment rates..If govt is really doing good then they should be talking about jobs and employment in the election rallies and propaganda…

But there are commendable positives like startups, digital economy

Do you think if this govt had created enough jobs during its tenure, they wouldn’t have made a huge campaign and drumbeating about it? 

This govt celebrates even the smallest of things like the biggest of things …

What about religious hatred that is being spread and whats the point of all the wealth or infrastructure if you dont have social harmony in the country and have riots like scenario?

Whats the point of all the development when you dont have basic freedoms to eat wear love marry according to your choice..

Like many have pointed out, the trajectory this govt is on would end up being a banana republic like china with dystopian human rights and liberties minus the infrastructure that china enjoys. (*this is the best they can do at  their best, assuming no corruption, rapid industrialisation, infrastructure, which is unrealistic, so we would end up with worst human rights and mediocre infrastructure*) 

If democracy is intact and breathing incompetence and flaws of govt can be exposed and made accountable,
Once you become authoritarian, what can anyone do even if you don’t do any infrastructure development? 

Even if you ignore allllllll these things just answer this question: 

**If the Modi Govt is doing sooooo good (whatever this good means to you) then why do they need to demolish democracy?

Wont they be re-elected anyways if they did such an amazing work that you some of you believe?   

Rig elections in broad daylight, Jail opponents, break parties, suppress freedom, suppress and control media, do all these nonsense religious hatred, pass bills without discussion debate, use money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, suspend opposition MPs enmasse etc

Generally, No party appeal to their traditional voters in elections, as they will vote to them anyway, they have no choice. They appeal to swing voters who change their votes every election (as any sane voter should do). They are the kingmakers. That's why, in the past two elections, the BJP limited their election campaign to development and non-communal issues. This election is the first time they are openly going communal.

They know development plank in not going to work on swing voters as they have been fooled two times in the row. They know even their traditional voters, who love to hate Muslims, are reconsidering voting to BJP. Hence, it is important for them to save their traditional votes. That's why we are listening this much of Hindu-muslim from PM speeches. In other elections, it is just sprinkled here and there, not the main focus of election campaign, as communal speeches dissuade swing voters who vote on issues mainly.",156,0.81,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ck1eo0/it_seems_like_bjp_is_struggling_to_hold_its/,SlowNSensible,2024-05-04 14:20:07
1cfu5vp,India,election campaign,False election tropes - lessons from 2019,"Here are some election tropes going around now that were also circulating back in Apr/May 2019: 

&nbsp;

**1) The Modi is nervous trope**. 

Here's Modi being ""nervous"" in 2019. We all know how that went in the end:

+ [Modi cracking under pressure: Rahul Gandhi on PM’s interview spree](https://indianexpress.com/elections/rahul-gandhi-narendra-modi-congress-bjp-lok-sabha-elections-2019-5719959/)

Much was made of the May 2019 press conference where Modi appeared listless and uncomfortable. Many people saw an election loss in that behaviour. Nothing of the sort happened.

&nbsp;


**2) The poor turnout / anti-incumbency / people-are-tired-of-hate tropes**:

&nbsp;

There are two types of people who make these predictions.

&nbsp;

First type are well-intentioned but overly optimistic liberal / left / progressive types who don't understand the average Hindu mindset and aren't ready to admit that Hindutva understands that shitty mindset perfectly.

They understand booth strategy even less. Due to the FPTP system, just overall vote share isn't everything. Voteshare must be micro-managed and maximized at the booth level, both through legitimate methods and dirty tricks like voter list manipulation. Modi-Shah are masters of it.

I understand the desperation for hope. I experienced it myself back in 2019. I see some people, perhaps new voters of the last 5 years, making the same mistake. Saying things like ""He's sure to lose this time!"" Don't make that mistake. 

Ask yourself a simple question: Do you suddenly see any new ""enlightenment"" or ""critical thinking"" in the masses around you? And does that even happen in a rigid society where there was absolutely no improvement in education, awareness, or quality of opposition?

&nbsp;

Second type who spread these news are centrist / centre-right columnists and editors with hindutva sympathies who are essentially running a psychological gaslighting long con. They create an emotional state of false hope in the liberal groups, and an emotional state of fear in the rightwing groups. Then wait for counting day in anticipation.

On counting day evening, when BJP's victory is inevitably announced, they can then pull the rug of hope from under liberal feet and delight both themselves and their rightwing fans.

After that,  in a week-long orgy of gloating, they'll publish article after article suggesting how and why ""liberals must introspect."" Tavleen Singh is probably already working on this right now.

The gloating BJP SM warriors will pass around these articles, including here on Reddit, along with copious use of the word ""burnol"" in their comments. 

I suspect these psych campaigns are BJP-sponsored at the very least, may be even state-sponsored.

&nbsp;

So I'd suggest not believing optimistic takes and tropes.

The observation is easy to make: Do you see any signs of ""enlightenment"" in the masses around you? I certainly don't. A society, especially a religious conservative immature one like ours, doesn't magically enlighten itself within 5-6 months, that too in the absence of any compelling person or group working to actively bring such an improvement. It won't magically leap from misinformation and hate to ethics and acceptance within months.

IMO, there's no convertible anger against Modi whatsoever. He'll win comfortable majority, maybe even cross the 350 mark by himself. Just prepare yourself mentally for it.",278,0.94,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1cfu5vp/false_election_tropes_lessons_from_2019/,tech-writer,2024-04-29 08:42:55
1bx3eol,India,election campaign,"Having watched speeches from BJP, INC, and AAP, it's surprising how Congress doesn’t know how to connect with the masses and counter BJP's narratives. BJP excels in propaganda, but I believe AAP might be the dark horse on winning the masses. Please share your thoughts!","**BJP-The elephant in the room!**

* **Mastery of Propaganda**
	+ BJP has **mastered the art of propaganda**, almost like they have religiously followed the Nazi propaganda machine.
	+ They show an alternate vision (utopian and vague in description) to the people from the current status quo.
	+ In 2014 elections, they showed an alternate vision where **corruption would be uprooted** and price rise would be controlled. Their core vision back then was ""Acche Din"".
	+ To win and reach the masses, the propaganda does not need to be specific. Very vague and well-repeated statements do the job.
* **Vague and Repeated Statements**
	+ Just keep at it.
	+ Since it is vague, people can themselves imagine the kind of future it would be to fill in the gaps.
	+ For unemployed, the ""Acche Din"" would be to have jobs. For those who were fed up of corruption in govt offices, they would imagine a future (""Acche Din"") where there would be no corruption. So every person can now fit in their ideas of ""Acche Din"" and visualize it for themselves.
* **New Propaganda Every 5 Years**
	+ They never repeat the same propaganda vision. Every 5 years they come up with new propaganda vision since each one has a shelf life which keeps the masses hooked and talking.
	+ Then it was 5$ Trillion economy. Now they are talking about ""Viksit Bharat 2047"" or Developed India by 2047.
	+ They don't define what developed India would mean. They just talk about it so vaguely, and then let the audience imagine and visualize what Viksit Bharat would mean.

* **Central Strongman Character Cult Around Modi**
	+ BJP has a carefully crafted central strongman character cult around Modi.
	+ Because this charismatic personality is enticing, people believe in this man and that he can do whatever he tells them.
	+ Which translates to ""Modi Hai toh Mumkin Hai"" perception.

* **Censored Data and Information**
	+ They make sure that the data regarding the past propaganda visions never come out or are immensely censored and kept hidden from the public, so that media( I know I know its largely captured) and others cannot talk about it.
	+ So without having data, the common man cannot judge whether the past propaganda has been successful or not and just buys out the rosy data put out by the government.
	+ Finally add hyper nationalism, religious sentiments to the mix and you have a perfect soup of motivating people to vote for you by winning and playing with their emotions.

**Congress**

* **Reactive and Not Proactive**
	+ I have honestly found their speeches and manifesto to be reactive and not proactive.
	+ They just react to BJP and not set an alternative vision.
	+ They are unable to really touch the nerves of the people and I feel that they lack mass oratory speakers..
	+ I would argue that they won Karnataka and Telangana not on their own, but because of severe failure of the then ruling parties and allegations of neck deep corruption.

**Possible Solution**

+ Congress should talk about an alternative vision. But here’s the catch. They cannot talk about an alternative vision vaguely and get away with it because the BJP and its entire machinery of Media and IT cell would ruthlessly attack them as saying they do not have any backing to their plans and that they would make the country bankrupt or they criticise congress’ manifesto by using fear tactics: tell the people repeatedly the imagined catastrophic consequences if congress comes to power.
	+ So congress has to make their vision somewhat specific wherever possible in a way that it is hard to counter and in order to win the credibility of people.
	+ They need to keep talking and repeating the same thing and hammer it down.

**AAP-The Dark Horse**

* **Stealthy Centrist Approach**
	+ AAP on the other hand has chosen the middle way of the both extremes. (Centrist)
	+ I think they are the ones who are really winning. Not BJP and Not Congress.
* **Focus on Welfare**
	+ Watch any speech of Arvind Kejriwal, he says we only talk you and your welfare, we dont ask votes in the name of religion and caste, we only about your welfare…we only talk about Schools, Hospitals, Electricity, Water and other essential amenities/facilities like transport…and in a very non corrupt way.
	+ They say they will not unduly interfere in your life and your life choices, it is your personal life and we only care about your welfare and standards is what they say.
* **Marketing Delhi as a Model**
	+ They are marketing Delhi as a model and promoting themselves saying if you vote us, you will get what Delhi already has.
	+ I dont live in Delhi to actually verify this, but the strategy of campaigning they have chosen is excellent.

* **Educational Qualifications of Kejriwal**
	+ Arvind Kejriwal himself is an IITian and also been an IRS officer. Like dude has top notch educational qualifications.
	+ So it gains credibility in the minds of people.
* **Connecting with the Masses**
	+ Second, in the north he can directly connect with the masses by talking in Hindi..and his probability of winning is maximum in the northern states surrounding Delhi, he says in his speeches that come visit Delhi and see for yourself or call up your relatives in Delhi and ask them how it has developed.
	+ And the Hindi belt is the region which decides whether you form the govt at the centre or not. So they focus more on those regions gradually branching out of Delhi.

1d98ta7,India,election results,Election results have revealed Modi followers for who they truly are,"Ever since the election results came out, there's been a disturbing amount of hate directed at Hindus by hardcore Modi supporters. These ""Modi bh@#ts"" are hurling insults at Dalits and other minorities, calling them beggars, traitors, hijra’s and worse, just because they didn't vote for Modi. It’s pretty ridiculous because voting is a personal right. If Modi wants their votes, he needs to earn them, not demand them.

What’s clear from all this abuse is how much disdain these so called protectors of Hindutva have for Hindus who don't toe their line. Their actions indicate a belief that Dalits and minorities should remain subservient, never daring to raise their voices. This has been evident for some time, from the horrors of Hathras to the appalling incident where a BJP leader urinated on a tribal, to how they treat of the President of India.

Now, with the election results, the mask has slipped, showing the pure hatred BJP supporters have for Hindus who don't behave as they want. Modi himself has started acting like he's above Ram. He’s been proclaiming that he’s not of biological birth. But let’s be real: neither Ram nor Hindus need the ""protection"" of these fake Hindus. They're not Ram bh@#ts; they’re Modi bh@#ts. They’ve basically turned into a cult that worships Modi, they will even turn against Lord Ram himself for Modi.

Hindus have survived for thousands of years without the “protection” of Modi, BJP & Modi bh@#ts and they will continue to survive without these morons.

If Hindus are in danger from anyone then it’s from the cult of Modi.",2815,0.87,328,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1d98ta7/election_results_have_revealed_modi_followers_for/,Mayor_McCheese7,2024-06-06 03:30:57

1crlwfp,India,election results,Why is social media (reddit/twitter) hyping that BJP will lose?,"I don’t sense anti incumbency against BJP…and dont see them losing seats significantly (If any)

As much as I want the current government to change, im mentally prepared for the worst and hoping for the best.

The worst is that BJP will repeat its 2019 result (peak BJP moment) which is still unlikely given that farmers, unemployed youth and poor people who make up large part of rural electorate seem upset.. BJP traditionally gets more Urban votes than Rural, whereas congress gets more of its votes from Rural people and significantly lower urban voters

One of the major factors of voting psychology is that its not just the past performance that is judged, but also who is likely to solve their problems if elected and this perception is largely in favour of Modi. A lot of people still believe that Modi will solve their problems even if he hasn’t been able to do so in the past 10 years.

They will vote for someone who gives them hope.

Even assuming all these Problems will make a dent, but this is unlikely to bring them below 272..Why? Because BJP has big margin, and all these issues will eat into their huge margin And reduce their vote share but not their seat share.

Best case scenario would be BJP below 272 (around 250-260), at this point they would be dependent on their allies and they wont be as authoritarian as they are today and it wont be two man show (modi shah)

But thats just me, I dont find significant anti incumbency..in short there will be turbulence for the BJP but not enough to injure them..",655,0.85,397,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1crlwfp/why_is_social_media_reddittwitter_hyping_that_bjp/,Julius_seizure_2k23,2024-05-14 06:57:55

They are largely united and not giving in. The BJP doesn’t seem to be confident anymore that they can win by a large margin. Rahul Gandhi’s image got transformed during his Yatra. I really have to commend his social media team as a lot of videos were so heart warming. I was ambivalent towards the congress before it, now I can really appreciate Rahul Gandhi. Congress manifesto is quite clear about what they plan to implement if they come to power. I quite liked the way they solidified the 5 Nyays after his Nyay Yatra indicating that it’s what people feel they need. Arvind Kejriwal too seems to be in form after his stint in jail. Other leaders are backing India alliance as well without much infighting at the moment. 

I think the opposition is doing great compared to 2019. There is negatively all around if I look at the BJP, polarisation to the extreme and general dissatisfaction. On the other hand, I feel the opposition is spreading hope and positivity. It is talking of a better India where people are more content. 

South is beyond BJP’s control, east prefers regional parties. Even in the north, if we look beyond the craze for hindutva, a lot of people are slightly fed up of BJP due to inflation and unemployment. I am not saying opposition will win but we have reached a position where we can’t be sure of the results at all.

>Imagine if there was a level playing field for the opposition. Despite all these odds, Gandhi emerged as an ultimate challenge for Modi in these elections. For many, he is the answer to if not Modi then who? A recent CSDS survey in UP noted that for 36% people Gandhi is the first choice for prime minister. He was the undeclared anchor of the INDIA alliance, the only opposition leader whose stature has become so towering that Modi couldn’t scare him with force.

>His word would set the agenda for the opposition. So, to deny him his credit and moment of glory is unfair, especially when he’s been declared the sole reason for all the losses that his party has faced in the past decade. 

>You’d find innumerable articles on why Gandhi’s supposed hard left turn is dangerous and politically suicidal, but it’s exactly this shift that has made him one of the most popular leaders in India today. Being pro-poor and pro-marginalized can never make a politician unpopular in a country that’s always looking out for messiahs. From 2014 to 2019, these commentators advised the Congress to ignore the ‘fringe’ hate mongers. Congress did that and failed. Mocking Modi was termed as political suicide. Questioning institutions and talking about cronyism was also shunned. Gandhi could only succeed by doing the exact opposite. Unlike 2019, when the BJP had forced Gandhi to look more Hindu and claim that he’s a Brahmin for greater acceptance amongst the majority, this time around Gandhi did none of that.  He didn’t fall into Modi’s traps and instead compelled Modi to respond to his charges.

>Be it Modi’s astonishing outburst against Adani and Ambani or his impassioned defense of the constitution and reservation, Gandhi forced him to do that. For the first time, Modi stands on shaky ground. It won’t be an exaggeration to say that brand Modi is a sinking ship and we can already see the jumping rats. This has partly happened due to Modi’s own arrogance and contempt for others. His “*ek akela sab par bhaari hai* (one man vs everyone else)” and “*Kaun Rahul* (who’s Rahul)” find few buyers today.

1cqcphm,India,INDIA alliance,"Bad ruling party, failed opposition","Many people are not happy with the current government so, they are voting for the opposition alliance. While ""not being in agreement with the current government"" is a valid reason to vote for the opposition it should not be the only argument. We should vote someone that satisfies our individual demands and also takes important national commitments in consideration.

Now, we as a nation have failed in building an opposition. In all these years we could not find a better face than RaGa. Let's ignore RaGa for a moment, even if congress forms govt. it will be coalition government. Now, every party has different ideologies so, they will clash often, creating instability. Every decision will take longer duration. It should satisfy all the parties (even if it is harmful for the nation to consider certain conditions of some party). Example: Let the govt. agrees to south states that center will contribute to the states according to their share of GST, then, Bihar will protest, because they will not get any funds. It is harmful for the nation also, because rich states will become richer and poor states will become poorer.

We failed to question the opposition -

1. Was there no-one better than RaGa in these ten years? And why everytime RaGa?

1d8jy3c,India,INDIA alliance,Who's becoming New PM ?,"
Now, That NDA has some 293 seats INDIA has some 234 seats and 16 for other parties.

Who's forming Government ?

Let me first tell you that we're in for long unstable government I think atleast for an decade.

Now, The logic says NDA is forming the Government however it's not as simple as it sounds, since Nitish and Naidu Hold for some 28 seats.

Nitish, Naidu and Modi all them have even chances of becoming a PM at this point.

All of them are OG politicians so they understand that this will be once in a life time opportunity to become PM.

Nitish has been Offered Deputy PM from India so It's natural he'll need better offer from NDA to continue.

But will NDA even agree on this probably or probably not!

Naidu has won election with Majority in Andhra so He also doesn't need the support from BJP for State Elections as well. Plus he was the one saying anyone but Modi for PM for long time. Although he has been long term loyal partner of BJP since Vajpayee there is still chance.

Let's say both stay on the Side of NDA for now but even that won't make things easier since now every single seat is crucial every BJP members like Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath has the Opportunity to become the PM if Nitish and Naidu back someone from OG members that will be tough for Modi to come again.

Modi although won't settle for less than PM but if NDA make Modi PM they'll risk the next elections into Risk since Modi will not be allowed to run for PM next elections for sure.

And to win next elections RSS will need to do alot of reformations in Branding, Ideological shift also will happen, and they'll need to prepare the next face of BJP but since Modi will be PM of India I don't think he'll let any other face shine other than him since we all know he's the Most Egoistic Creature on Earth. Which will make it harder for that New face to win directly in next elections so it will be also crucial for RSS to let someone new take up now and make a strong point for next elections.


Now, for New PM as well it will be harder to run the country since Opposition will be in the picture for everything they do and next decade will be full of andolans and Media being more on Neutral Side.

This way opposition will become stronger but not by alot and NDA will be weaker but not by a lot as well.

Also, there is chances of INDIA Alliance breaking but they'll also understand that they don't hold any value as individual parties when BJP is there. There won't be a single party which can challange the BJP directly if they break up so we might see them for atleast this term ( few partners might leave but few will join as well)

So till next elections I think we can see BJP coming to some 200-210 mark and Congress coming up the ladder to 120-130 mark. Which might lead to another term of unstable government.

Also, there is chance BJP buys out MPs from INDIA. There is also a chance the MPs from BJP go to India since many of them came thinking Easy wins due to Face of Modi hut that will not be case next elections. So will see lots of trading as well 


Conclusion: NDA forming Government good chance that New Face becomes PM and Not Modi and high chance of new government mid term as well.


Things I read on Twitter:

- Naidu demanded for Amit Shah to Leave Home Ministry 
- RSS looking for New Leader options and Gadkari Leading the talks
- Yogi or RSS being Major Reason behind UP loss.

# tl;dr

The Union Budget for 2024-2025 reveals an overall increase in funds allocation for MeitY, MHA, MIB, and DoT as compared to 2023-2024. The Budget allocated to MeitY has witnessed the highest increase among these ministries – 32.56% over last year's – yet-to-be-formed Data Protection Board and the IndiaAI Mission gets funding for the first time however, rural digital literacy scheme PMGDISHA gets no funding (for the second year in a row). Although DoT cut funding for USOF by \~80% as compared to 2023-2024 Budget, it increased funding for BharatNet by 70%. While the overall increase in budgetary allocations compared to last year may paint a positive picture, on deeper analysis we realise that the decline in fund allocation towards long-established schemes and projects as well as underutilisation of funds continue to be unaddressed issues and thus a cause of contention.

# Introduction

In the final session of the 17th LS term, Union Finance Minister, Shrimati Nirmala Sitharaman, presented the Union Interim Budget for the Financial Year (“**FY**”) 2024-2025. In the ongoing Monsoon Session, the Union Finance Minister placed a new Budget for the FY2024-2024 in both houses on July 23, 2024. The Budgeted Estimates (“**BE**”) for the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (“**MeitY**”), Ministry of Home Affairs (“**MHA**”), Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (“**MIB**”), and Department of Telecommunications (“**DoT**”) witnessed an overall increase of 15.98% in the 2024-25 Union Budget compared to 2023-2024 BE. 

The budget allocated to MeitY has witnessed the highest increase (32.56%) among these Ministries in comparison to the previous Budget (2023-2024) and DoT witnessed the second highest (14.7%). The Budget for MHA and MIB got a 9.44% and 7.45% increase respectively. The increase in the BE for this fiscal year from the Revised Estimates (“**RE**”) of the previous year was also the highest for MeitY (52.11%). While DoT and MHA saw an increase of 13.79% and 9.44% respectively, MIB witnessed a decrease of 2.41% since the RE of 2023-2024.

Table 1: Total Expenditure for MeitY, MIB, DoT, and MHA (In Rs. Crores)

Digital Public Infrastructure (“**DPI**”) was an area of focus for the government during the presentation of the Union Budget including the varying schemes aimed at farmers with the digital crop survey, agri-stack, and also the service sector with a proposal for the development of more DPI apps for businesses. However, it appears that DPI(s) found limited specific budgetary allocation even after being a point of focus in the Economic Survey released a day before the Budget 2024-25. DPIs have been attributed for the rise in technological engagement of Indian citizens with more Ministries introducing population-scale interactive technological platforms which are being clubbed under the common banner of DPI. We will soon release a detailed analysis of the Economic Survey 2023-2024 and the over-reliance on technology-centred tools such as AI and DPI within it.

# The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology

The total budgetary allocation for MeitY in the Budget for 2024-2025 is ₹21936.9 Cr, which is a 32.57% increase from the previous financial year’s Budget (BE 2023-2024). The increase is even higher when compared to the RE of 2023-2024, i.e., a year-on-year change of 52.11%. This is in contrast to the budgetary trends we witnessed in 2021, 2022 and 2023, where there was underutilisation of the budget. We appreciate the large overall increase in budgetary allocation to MeitY in FY 2024-2025 and hope to see these funds be directed towards infrastructure development aimed at increasing telecom and broadband connectivity, research and deep deliberation into emerging technologies, strengthening of citizen-centric fora and systems, and closing the digital divide.

Table 2: Budgetary allocations for specific items for MeitY

The most notable change in the Budget for 2024-2025, which has direct implications for digital rights, has to be the allocation of ₹2 Cr for the Data Protection Board (“**DPB**”). After a long and arduous journey for data protection legislation, it is disappointing to see funding of a mere ₹2 Cr for a regulatory body whose functioning will have a direct impact on the implementation of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (“**DPDPA**”), 2023, successful or otherwise. Of this ₹2 crore, only ₹4 lahks is [\~reportedly\~](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-budget-2024-25-health-ministry-allocated-rs-90-958-crore-full-details-101721738915694.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) allocated for capital expenditure, which includes fixed assets such as the digital portal, and the rest (₹ 1.96 Cr) is allocated for revenue expenditure (salaries, etc). Since it is unclear when the DPB will become functional, it is difficult to ascertain whether the allocated budget is meant to  be utilised for the entire financial year or a part of it. Either way, a minuscule amount of ₹4 lakhs for capital expenditure on DPB may prove to be insufficient for upskilling and training of the DPB members. In the following Budgets, we hope MeitY ensures that it is adequately resourced for the institutional preparation of the DPB. Adequate funding for key regulatory bodies such as the DPB will contribute to its independent functioning which is necessary to keep checks and balances on the executive. 

Allocation towards a prominent regulatory body essential for the cybersecurity health of the country, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (“**CERT-In**”) also increased by 5.78% from the previous year’s Budget. On another positive note, funding allocated to ‘Cyber Security Projects’ has seen a massive increase of 89.75% since last year. This substantial increase in allocation was much needed in the backdrop of increasing incidents of data breaches and vulnerabilities and the absence of an operational, robust, and rights-advancing data protection legislation. [\~Recent\~](https://internetfreedom.in/cybersecurity-report-for-q2-2024/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) grave cybersecurity incidents, like the Tamil Nadu Police Facial Recognition Portal breach and the Telangana Police Network data leak, have raised concerns about the detection and response capabilities of India’s cybersecurity authorities. It is worth noting that MeitY utilised only ₹30.11 Cr out of the allocated ₹300 Cr in 2022-2023, despite persisting challenges of insufficient resources, outdated infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled professionals. We hope that the same trend of under-utilisation is not followed by the Ministry this fiscal year and ahead.

Another introduction this year was the addition of ‘IndiaAI Mission’ as a Central Sector Scheme, with a notable allocation of ₹551.75 Cr. This is on top of the infusion of ₹10,371.92 Cr [\~approved\~](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2012355&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) by the previous National Democratic Alliance (“**NDA**”) cabinet in March 2024 which is to be disbursed over a period of five years to establish the scheme including its Compute Capacity program. The program [\~aims\~](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2012355&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to establish a 10,000 Graphics Processing Unit infrastructure to be built with public-private partnerships. The working group appointed by the government on IndiaAI in its October 2023 [\~report\~](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/IndiaAI-Expert-Group-Report-First-Edition.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) had recommended at least 24,500 Graphics Processing Units for infrastructural requirements. Moreover, the increased focus on AI and massive budgetary allowances form cause for concern owing to the massive effects of the technology on the climate – with a single ChatGPT search taking 10 times as much energy as a regular Google search, according to the [\~Economic Survey 2023-24\~](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/index.php?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). The Survey cautioned against Artificial Intelligence’s impact not only on climate but also on employment opportunities amidst rising automation in industries making employees redundant. With increasing trends of techno-solutionism plaguing governance in India, increased budgetary focus on bolstering AI capabilities may result in more unnecessary technological interventions – but now with AI.

Disappointingly, the Budget for 2023-2024 and the Interim Budget for 2024-2025 for MeitY did not allocate any funds to Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (“**PMGDISHA**”), breaking the trend of continuous budgetary support for the rural digital literacy scheme since its inception in 2017. PMGDISHA was key to increased connectivity, telecom penetration, and digital literacy across India. Allocations to the scheme touched an all-time low in 2022 since 2017, and then last year in the FY 2023-24 budget, no funds were allocated towards it. The last impact assessment study of PMGDISHA was carried out by the Indian Institute of Public Administration in 2020-21. The report [\~concluded\~](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1843061&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) that the scheme, as a digital literacy programme, “*plays an indispensable part in not only bridging the digital gap in the country but also transforming it into a knowledge economy and society*.” The allocations made to this scheme must increase, and more importantly exist, to ensure its effective progress and robust digital literacy in the country.

Figure 1: Budget Allocation to PMGDISHA (MeitY)

The other interesting trend is the complete discontinuation of budgetary allocation towards ‘Promotion of Digital Payments’ under MeitY’s budget for this year. Last year, we noted that the allocation to this domain plummeted to ₹1500 Cr as compared to ₹2137 Cr allocated to it in the 2022-2023 RE, reflecting a decline of 29.8%. In the RE of 2023-2024, the allocation was further reduced to ₹584 Cr and finally to 0 in the Budget for 2024-2025. It is also interesting to note that revised allocations increased sharply in 2022-2023 (₹2137 Cr), witnessing a jump of 968.5% as compared to the 2022-2023 BE which stood at ₹200 crores. Even though the allocation in 2023-2024 is higher than the 2022 BE, it stood lower than the RE.

Figure 2: Budgetary Allocation to ‘Promotion of Digital Payments’ (MeitY)

MeitY has introduced an item titled ‘Promotion of Digital Transactions (excluding Digital Payments)’ under the DIGITAL INDIA Program, for which it has allocated ₹1.5 Cr. As per MeitY, the objective of this scheme is to promote overall digitisation for the efficient delivery of citizen-centric services and empowerment of citizens. Through this newly introduced item, MeitY hopes to grow the volume of digital transactions in the country. It also believes that this expenditure may have a cascading effect on the promotion of digital payments scheme including estimating and measuring digital economy of India, suggesting a measurement framework for such estimation, and providing suitable policy recommendations for boosting the size and growth of the digital economy in India by leveraging the digital technologies. Interestingly, despite this new addition, the total expenditure towards the DIGITAL INDIA Program has reduced significantly and consistently since the BE for 2022-2023.

Figure 3: Share of the Digital India Programme in the Total Budgetary Allocation (MeitY)

# The Ministry of Home Affairs

The total budgetary allocation for MHA is 9.44% higher than what was allocated in the BE for 2023-24 and 9.44% higher than the 2023-2024 revised Budget. The allocation in the budget estimates, net of receipts and recoveries, for MHA is ₹6458.24 Cr. The allocation for planned capital expenditure has marginally dipped as compared to both 2023-2024 BE (by 10.16%) and RE (by 29.39%), which is disappointing. 

https://preview.redd.it/1utn61dekled1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=551bc23902cc2389ecffb663e38358d90fed53c7

Table 3: Budgetary allocations for specific items for MHA

Additionally, we notice an interesting trend in allocations to the item ‘Census, Survey and Statistics/ Registrar General of India’. For the past few years, the estimated budget for surveys and census has been large, but the actual utilisation remains minuscule. The biggest dip was seen in 2022-23, where the budget allocated was ₹3676 Cr, but only ₹513.18 Cr was utilised. For BE 2024-25, the allocation remains large, but it is likely to fall into the same pattern of remaining underutilised

https://preview.redd.it/9k7es0glhled1.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee095f22bd9450b54e675010741be0f25e8204a2

Figure 4: Budgetary Allocation to Census, Survey and Statistics/Registrar General of India (MHA)

On a disappointing note, MHA did not allocate any funds towards its [\~Cyber and Information Security\~](https://www.mha.gov.in/en/divisionofmha/cyber-and-information-security-cis-division?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) (“**C&IS**”) Division, which includes key schemes such as the Cybercrime Prevention against Women and Children Scheme and the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (“**I4C**”) Scheme. [\~Reportedly\~](https://theprint.in/economy/budget-2024-mha-gets-rs-2-19-lakh-crore-focus-on-training-and-research-big-boost-for-ib-cisf/2187805/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), I4C didn’t get fresh funding this year because it “*ceased to exist as a Union government scheme starting 1 July and began working as part of the MHA*”. Interestingly, other Divisions of the MHA such as the Freedom Fighters and Rehabilitation Division and the Police Division still got funding allocated to them. From a reading of the Budget, it is unclear under which item, if at all, is MHA allocating funds for cyber security and awareness efforts. Earlier this year, I4C was [\~notified\~](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/govt-designates-i4c-as-agency-of-mha-to-notify-unlawful-activities-in-cyber-world/articleshow/108501675.cms?from=mdr&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) as the official agency by MHA to notify law enforcement authorities, under the Information Technology Act, 2000, about unlawful activities in the cyberspace. Additionally, funding for a special wing of ""cyber commandos"", reportedly an MHA project meant to tackle cyber threats along with local administration, is also missing from this year’s Budget for MHA, despite [\~expectations\~](https://www.business-standard.com/budget/news/budget-special-unit-of-cyber-commandos-on-home-ministry-s-100-day-agenda-124062100754_1.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

# The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting

The total budgetary allocation for MIB in 2024-25 is ₹4342.55 Cr, which is a 7.45% decrease from the 2023-2024 Budget and a 2.41% decrease from the 2023-2024 Revised Budget. This cut comes after MIB seemingly was able to utilise a higher budget allocation last year, which seems incongruent. Interestingly, the total budgetary allocation for FY 2024-2025 is the same as the allocation under the Interim Budget for 2024-2025, a trend uncommon for several other Ministries. 

https://preview.redd.it/uumo8ingkled1.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=01047f19263b763a7e3b4810d6ed10b8db6225d6

Table 4: Budgetary allocations for specific items for MHA

MIB’s total AE since 2014-2015 has been relatively stable, as compared to the AE of MeitY, MHA, and DoT. Notably, DoT has introduced funding for the establishment of the ‘Bhartiya Bhasha Anubhag’ scheme, which is a platform meant to facilitate the translation of various languages into Hindi and vice versa. 

# The Department of Telecommunications

In 2024-25, DoT (which operates under the Ministry of Communications) has been allocated ₹111915.43 Cr, which is a 14.69% increase over the budget allocated in 2023-24 (₹97579.05 Cr) and 13.78% over the RE for 2023-24 (₹98359.41 Cr). 

https://preview.redd.it/yzzfatlkkled1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f008461ad146f06dd70fbb69a19d92873554303

Table 4: Budgetary allocations for specific items for DoT

Surprisingly, the Universal Services Obligation Fund (“USOF”) took a hit in funds with only ₹2000 Cr allocated to it in the 2024-25 Budget (same as last year’s RE), an 80.77% fall from last year’s ₹10400 Cr. Telecom services providers have [\~persistently\~](https://www.business-standard.com/budget/news/budget-wish-list-telecom-industry-calls-for-junking-usof-slashing-duties-124011800938_1.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) urged the Ministry of Finance to suspend USOF till the existing corpus is exhausted, and in their Budget requests for 2024-25, pressed for an exemption from the service tax on “assignment of right to use natural resources” and the slashing of customs duty on telecom equipment to zero. Allocation to ‘Compensation to Telecom Service Providers’ saw a 102% increase in the 2024-2025 Budget (₹10100 Cr) as compared to the 2023-2024 budget (₹5000 Cr). This item is meant to provide for the “*creation and augmentation of telecom infrastructure and access to various telecom services to people in the rural and remote areas including operation and maintenance of Village Public Telephones*.”

As far as allocations for BharatNet are concerned, there has been a significant increase of 70% in BE 2024-25 (₹8500 Cr) from BE 2023-24 (₹5000 Cr). The grant goes towards the creation of telecom infrastructure required for providing broadband connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats in the country and facilitating non-discriminatory access to service providers, for provisioning of broadband services in rural areas. The sharp increase in budget is appreciated.

Total budgetary allocation for regulatory bodies such as the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (“**TRAI**”) and Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal has seen a significant dip this year (₹113 Cr) as compared to the previous year (₹238.53 Cr). The funding for TRAI has reduced by 48.68% over the past year, even though DoT utilised the entire revised amount allocated in 2022-2023 for the regulatory body, which was more than the BE for 2022-2023.

Although DoT allocated ₹50,00,000 towards ‘Artificial Intelligence and Face Recognition Powered Solution for Telecom SIM Subscriber Verification (ASTR)’ in the 2023-2024 Budget, it has not allocated any funding in the 2024-2025 Budget. Funding for the Digital Intelligence Unit Project, which is meant to investigate fraudulent activity involving telecom resources, such as Unsolicited Commercial Communication, witnessed a drastic reduction of 61.36% in the 2024-2025 Budget (₹85 Cr) as compared to the previous Budget (₹220 Cr). DoT has also allocated ₹38.76 Cr for the first time for the ‘Prevention of Spoofed Incoming International Calls System – 'CIOR' (Centralized International Out Roamer)’.

# Conclusion

The 2024-25 Budget leaves us with a variety of feelings, some of hope and some of disappointment. While there are some budgetary allocations made for the first time, like the DPB, IndiaAi Mission, and ‘Promotion of Digital Transactions’, long-established budgetary items such as the ‘Promotion of Digital Payments’, PMGDISHA, the Census, I4C, and the USOF either witnessed a complete discontinuation of funds or took a significant hit in the allocated funds. Overall funding towards the DPB includes planned capital expenditure of only ₹4 lakhs which is inadequate to say the least. An additional cause for concern is the decrease in the AE as compared to the RE, and in the RE as compared to the BE, for the last few years. The RE indicates how much is possible for the government to extend to the concerned sector and the AE indicates how much was extended. While some variation among the three is inevitable, too much of a difference can [\~reduce\~](https://www.indiaspend.com/budget/be-re-or-actuals-what-do-you-need-to-look-at-in-the-upcoming-budget-800937?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) the credibility of the numbers and cause uncertainty. Cuts in and underutilisation of the RE may also negatively affect the implementation of government schemes and projects. In light of the increasing digitisation across sectors and the increasing demand for improved digital literacy as well as access to digital services, we hope that the fund allocation in these concerned sectors continues to witness a positive trend. Although we appreciate the overall increase in BE this year as compared to last year, we hope to see these funds be utilised efficiently and directed towards infrastructure development aimed at increasing tele-connectivity, broadband connectivity, cybersecurity, and overall digital literacy.",3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ebmc2w/2024_budget_digital_rights_data_protection_board/,InternetFreedomIn,2024-07-25 04:47:53

1c6yx6y,India,Mamata Banerjee,If not Modi then who?,"Pre-2016 Narendra Modi.

The Narendra Modi characterised by his emphasis on development, anti-corruption stance, and opposition to dynasty politics that had and continues to plague our opposition space (bar the commies) and now, after 10 years of Modi’s rule, the BJP as well. The version of Modi that focused on economic growth, tackling inflation, modernising the military, enhancing quality of life for its citizens (UPI, VIP vehicles barred), and enhancing India's international standing. The Modi that took corruption head on via DBT and e-Assessments under ITA. The Modi that provided banking services, built toilets, and provided gas connection to our fellow citizens who were hitherto deprived of these services for 70 odd years. The Modi that rose to power without a single mention of polarising issues such as the Ram Mandir, anti-Muslim rhetoric, or Pakistan-centric narratives. The Modi that created an environment of positivity and optimism, the Modi who would herald *Aacche Din*. Modi from the time when his agenda and policies appeared more centrist and focused on governance rather than identity politics.

Not the cult leader Modi of today. Not the one who justifies what *prima facie* appears as blatant extortion scheme/probable money laundering scheme, not after all those tall lectures on corruption. Not the one who seeks votes because of his caste, or his religion. Let the opposition do it, you don’t leverage the same ailments in our republic that you sought to destroy. It was *Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas,* it should remain so. Not the Modi who’s carrying out the world’s grandest social engineering project that seeks to take our country back at least a 100 years. Not the Modi who lies between his teeth’s and stomps upon anyone who dares correct him. Not the Modi who looks aside on tragedies such as Manipur, for over a year, as there are no political dividends to be yielded by intervening. Not the megalomaniac, narcissist who has surrounded himself with sycophants of the highest order whose propensity to derriere licking is obnoxiously nauseating. Not the tunnel vision politician who didn’t even spare his octogenarian mother for PR during Demonetisation, who left her funeral midway so that the limelight of momentous inauguration of the first Vande Bharat in the East would not be hogged by Mamata Banerjee.

This Modi.

I’m as novice as it comes, but imho following the Bihar loss in 2015, and Bengal loss in 2016, Modi was disillusioned. He realised, as, in addition to electoral defeats, he faced further set backs on several schemes such as Make in India and Clean Ganga, that India at large is nowhere near the efficiency levels of an enterprising state such as Gujarat. And Indians do not really vote for progress, but hard and fast cash. Especially TMC sweeping Bengal notwithstanding Sarada and Narada Scams probably drove that point home.

Thereafter, you could observe this change that saw a greater focus on winning elections through strategies that are blatantly divisive and polarising. An entire generation is being raised to hate people who they’re gonna spend their lives in the company of. Dancing outside mosques, pelting stones from ceilings, this is what our youth is procuring their dopamine from. A mockery has been made of our constitutional bodies and individuals. Using ED to harass opposition, co-opting media to a degree that would make Putin blush, using Governors to impede the functioning of opposition ruled states. These precedents are irreversible. Modi won’t be here forever, so in a language that his fanbase understands, “*Khangress might come to power someday, and they will use the same tools to affect their anti-national, anti-hindu agenda.*” Are we prepared? No kidding.

He threw the entire economy into the gutter to win UP elections (ie Demonetisation), he disappeared in the face of the most severe crisis India faced since, idk, partition perhaps? (Covid 2021). Our people were dying like rats, and there was no accountability, no repercussions, no response. He resorts to deflecting blame on men who have been long dead to cover up for his own incompetence even after 10 years of unbridled power. 1 km of 4 lanes is now considered 4 kms, if electricity is provided to 10% households in a particular village, it is deemed that the entire village has been electrified, these are jacking up numbers, these numbers are then being proliferated at pace which can be considered as a form of disinformation especially as there are some nefarious devils in the details. Organised an event that is allocated without any merit, and projected it as being a mega achievement to his gullible followers. And now they want to host COP26 before 2029 elections which would imply they intend to keep Indians dumb and gullible for another 5 years at least.

Polarisation of public and pulverisation of republic (I came up with this and I love it).

Not to imply that there are no positives under Modi. He has delivered on several fronts, most significant of which was national security. Yes there were quite a few terror attacks in his regime as well but let’s not forget the pre-2014 weekly terror attacks. No city, no state was spared or safe.

Where it wasn’t Islamists or Pakistan sponsored terrorists, we had militants. A relative of mine was shot dead in 2009 by HNLC militants for not agreeing to what would be a fifth ransom payment.

Well, [ULFA disbands itself after peace agreement, to hand over arms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/ulfa-disbands-itself-after-peace-agreement-to-hand-over-arms/articleshow/107092221.cms?from=mdr)

Economy was handed the triple shock of Demonetisation, GST and 2019 Union Budget but since then they’ve tempered with it to a controlled degree. Our tax incidence has reduced without damaging our fiscal position (I may be culturally liberal, but fiscally I’m as conservative as they come) and in spite of the plethora of challenges NDA 2 faced (Covid, Ukraine War, Houthi attacks all of which pressurised Brent crude), they are not withering from the targets to consolidate our debts. I appreciate how he’s not backing down against outside intervention in our fragile state of Punjab. There is unprecedented (world class and not just basic) infrastructural development. This and many more, I’ve directly not been a direct beneficiary of anything as such, but he has a 70 odd percent approval rating, I’m assuming those in mainland are getting something at least.

I may criticise Modi all I want but truth be told he possesses the potential to enact transformative change in India and could change the fortunes of the country by his sheer cult of personality. If we could just impose certain costs that would make him focus on prioritising governance over electoral victories and refrain from divisive tactics such as conniving, lying, manipulating, and gas-lighting others to that end, which we know he’s capable of, he very well could go down as India’s Ataturk. Per the status quo, though, he’s gonna go down as the Hindu Zia ul Haq who converted—although scarcely but functionally—a secular India into Hindu Pakistan. Those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Its that simple, really.

If we could remind him, who he is, if we could just make him come out of this mega whatever induced trip that he’s on, and realise he will be remembered for longer if he makes us rich than he will be for refurbishing temple arenas, that could and would transform our fortunes. If we could somehow… he will be given the power, he and his team has the vision, enough manpower and with some effort he could get the money as well. If we could just remind him his mode of effective and efficient governance, and not he, was supposed to be the Gujarat Model that India gets, minus the minority stomping and oligarchy appeasement ofc, that’d be great.

Aayega toh Modi hi, toh kyun na pre-2016 Modi ko laye?

Because otherwise, think about it, this inducting members into the party regardless of their character so long as they augur positive electoral outcomes, vociferously targeting super-majority in parliament, stomping on small time politicians which one could construe as a lab rat experiment for bigger things to come, what the they up to?

Whatever that is, if it isn’t what Modi promised in 2014, it portends dangerous, ominous signals.

1aspawi,India,farmers protest,Some facts about the farmer's protest,"Been seeing a lot of comments and post about how agreeing to the farmer's demand would cost 10+ lakh crores. I hope you do realise that it is blatant propoganda. This article below does a decent job of debunking it. Just a little bit of research would help you separate fact from fiction/propoganda.

https://theprint.in/opinion/can-india-actually-afford-msp-for-farmers-its-a-question-of-political-will/588793/



Apart from this, the total debt of the farmers comes up to around 2 lakh crores.



Do you guys have any idea about the loans written off for the biggest corpos in the country since the last 10 years? It is over 4 times over the total debt of all farmers in the whole country.



You really think that it's fair that corpos receive this kind of treatment and be allowed to go scot free while the farmers far from receiving debt waiver, receive rubber bullets, pellets, tear gas and worse???


I request you guys to be a little bit empathetic and informed. It breaks my heart that the youth of the country has 0 empathy for the eveage person but are gladly bootlicking big coporates.

1b3npnt,India,farmers protest,Statement: Haryana Police Seeks to Cancel Passports and Visas of Farmers Identified Through Drone & CCTV cams to be “causing disturbances” during #FarmersProtest," Haryana police is in the process of cancelling passports and visas of farmers identified through drone and CCTV cameras to be “causing disturbances” during the farmers’ protests. We are deeply perturbed by this decision and the police’s unchecked use of surveillance technologies to crack down on dissent and free speech.

On February 23, IFF [**wrote**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gC_nnN9vQPCifwDovg7kA6yTW_Sf5ays/view?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to the Haryana Home Dept in response to the police’s use of drones to fire tear gas shells on protesting farmers. Here, we noted potential privacy concerns with the usage of drones during a protest, in the absence of any transparency on whether they were equipped with surveillance tools. It has now become clear that the drones had cameras, and our fears around protest surveillance have rung true.

Surveillance of protesters and collection of data about their faces, location or movement severely jeopardises their fundamental rights to privacy and to freedom of speech and movement, as enshrined in Art. 21, 19(1)(e) and 19(1)(d) of the Constitution respectively.

Indian police forces use drones and CCTV cameras in a regulatory vacuum. Haryana police claims that it has identified farmers ‘causing disturbances’ by “accessing their photos and residential details” – but we have little transparency into whether this was done through facial recognition technology, & how their personal data has been collected, used, stored, & shared.

Identification through surveillance tools such as CCTV cameras has been [**known**](https://www.commoncause.in/wotadmin/upload/REPORT_2023.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to be inaccurate and based on existing biases, which may unfairly misidentify and implicate any individual.

We are concerned that [**Haryana police’s extreme act**](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/haryana-police-farmers-passport-visa-cancellation-process-protesters-9187313/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of cancelling passports and visas, along with reportedly issuing notices to protesting farmers stating their farming lands will be seized and bank accounts frozen, is built on unregulated and inaccurate surveillance systems and instils a deafening chilling effect on every citizen’s fundamental right to protest drawing from Art. 19(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution.",330,0.9,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1b3npnt/statement_haryana_police_seeks_to_cancel/,InternetFreedomIn,2024-03-01 06:38:06

1bb2jsf,India,inflation India,Jinhe Naaz Hai Hind Par Wo Kahan Hai? An Important Appeal,"Friends, **today our nation stands at a crossroads.** Unemployment, price rise, economic inequality, and corruption are at their peak. Attacks on Dalits, Adivasis, minorities and women are on a rise. Our nation is being thrown into the fire of communalism and hate for the political gains.

**Unemployment has become a national calamity.** The Modi government, which came to power with the promise of two crore jobs, has betrayed the youth. Permanent jobs are being privatized and contractualized. Regular employment is shrinking, while wages are declining in real terms. In 2019, the unemployment rate reached its highest level in 45 years. Today, the youth unemployment in India stands at 40%, while more than 30 lakh sanctioned government posts are lying vacant. Through the Agnipath scheme, the government has compromised the national security and the future of the youth. Youths who demand employment are being violently repressed.

**Government has pushed the farmers and workers in a terrible tragedy.** Rising unemployment, falling income and price rise has wreaked havoc on the workers. Public sector units are being privatized. The government, which came to power with the promise of minimum support price and doubling the income of farmers, has betrayed the farmers. Agricultural income has declined, and farmers are falling in debt and dying by suicide. In 2020, when the nation was under lockdown, the Government passed the anti-farmer laws in a conspiracy with the capitalists. In a struggle against this, 750 farmers lost their lives. Meanwhile, a violent persecution and propaganda against the farmers continues to this day.

**Economic inequality is at its peak.** The poor and middle class are facing the brunt of inflation, while the government is distributing lakhs of crores of loan waivers and tax cuts to the crony capitalists. In the last three years, while the nation was reeling under COVID pandemic and economic downturn, the number of billionaires in India increased from 102 to 169. Allegations of corruption and corporate fraud have been covered up, and those raising questions have been silenced. At the same time, domestic savings have fallen to its lowest level in five decades. Social security and senior citizen's concessions are being taken away. The price of essential household items, including oil and gas, have risen sharply. Meanwhile, hunger and malnutrition has pushed the country to 111th place out of 125 countries in the Global Hunger Index, with three-quarters of the population unable to afford a balanced-diet.

In the last 10 years, **there has been an unprecedented rise in hatred and violence** against Dalits, tribals, minorities and women. The Modi government has sheltered rapists in spite of widespread protests. BJP leaders have publicly made hate speeches and called for violence. BJP-led governments have encouraged, sponsored, and protected the rioters. Our religious festivals have been taken over by a political mob.

Affirmative action policies are being weakened. **Dalits, backward classes, and women are being deprived of their constitutional right to social justice.** Forest Law has been amended to facilitate corporate takeover of forests and drive the adivasis off their lands. Overriding environmental concerns and objections raised by environmentalists and scientists, the Government has pursued disastrous projects which has caused irreparable damage to the environment and the human life.

The BJP government has launched an assault against universities and academic institutions. Scientific and historical facts are being replaced with propaganda and falsehood. Government has openly promoted unscientific and irrational ideas. **Health and education budget have been slashed.**

**There has been an unprecedented assault on democracy and the Constitution.** Mainstream media has become the megaphone of the Government. Independent journalists are being persecuted. Any kind of protest or dissent is crushed with force. Fundamental rights are being trampled. Institutions like CBI, ED, Income Tax have been turned into a political weapon. The autonomy of the judiciary and the Election Commission is under a threat. Parliament has been turned into a rubber stamp of the Executive. Federalism is being weakened with interference and attacks against the state governments.

In 2016, the Modi government announced demonetization of banknotes with a four-hour notice. More than 100 people died in this man-made disaster. Everything, from small businesses to everyday life, was thrown into despair. During the COVID pandemic, without any regard for the common people, the government imposed nationwide lockdown at a four-hour notice. Lakhs of workers lost their livelihood and crores of people had to face starvation. Migrant workers had to walk thousands of kilometres on foot. **47 lakh people died of COVID due to the government's indifference.** Lakhs of people died without oxygen and hospital beds. Due to a lack of space in crematoriums, rivers began overflowing with dead bodies.

Generating 2 crore employment opportunities every year, making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024, building 100 smart cities by 2023, doubling the farmer's income by 2022, creating 10 crore new jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2022, bringing back the black money in 100 days, **every promise turned out to be a jumla.** Meanwhile, BJP received secret donations of over ₹6,500 crore through electoral bonds. Manipur is in a state of civil war. China has occupied thousands of square kilometres of Ladakh, and built roads and villages within the Indian border in Arunachal Pradesh.

To hide these failures, the Modi government is using religion as its refuge. Festivals and faith are being politicized. The public is being misled by spending crores of rupees on publicity. The reality of hunger, poverty, inflation, and unemployment is being hidden behind the curtain with an endless propaganda of ’Acche Din’ and ’Amrit Kaal’. **Instead of guaranteeing fair price to the farmers, employment to youth, security to women, social justice to backward classes, education, health, and prosperity to the citizens, and unity and brotherhood for the nation, the ruling party is talking about “Modi ki Guarantee”.** At the same time, efforts are being made to amend the Constitution and replace the democratic republic with an authoritarian state. A concerted attack on the values of our freedom struggle is underway.

Friends, **today our country is facing an unprecedented crisis.** The freedom, achieved through countless sacrifices and a long struggle, whose values are enshrined in our Constitution, is under a threat. The nation envisioned by Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Azad, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Shaheed Bhagat Singh, is under a planned assault.

The 2024 Lok Sabha election is the most important election in our nation's history. It is not merely an election between two coalitions. It is an election for our nation's destiny, for the values of our freedom struggle, for the survival of our democratic republic, for a new struggle and nation building. 2024 Lok Sabha elections is a “Do or Die” moment for our country. **It is our historic responsibility to reject the anti-people politics of BJP and ensure a crushing defeat of the Modi government in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.** Let us, we, the people of India, unite in this historic struggle and defeat the anti-people Modi government.",204,0.65,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1bb2jsf/jinhe_naaz_hai_hind_par_wo_kahan_hai_an_important/,rishianand,2024-03-10 05:25:41

1e4ujew,India,corruption India,The one truth that can explain everything wrong with India.,"I saw a journalist on Twitter post a video of a man carrying his dead wife on his shoulder, exiting a hospital and marching his way home quite a distance away. The journalist mentioned in his caption how there’s no dignity in death, and there’s no ambulance or vehicle to carry the body home.

However, I saw nothing wrong in it. This journalist was speaking with a strange expectation, something I call, “big city standards.” People in much of India have been living this way for hundreds of years. Doesn’t he realize that?

All of the problems that us big city folk feel, can be attributed to a misplaced expectation of 21st century modern city standards on a country that is still largely pre industrial, living in the agricultural age, and even in the agricultural age, much of India still lives with back breaking field work in sweltering heat using primitive tools.

Let me remind you all that only 30% of India lives in cities with some semblance of 21st century life. 70% of India lives in the pre industrial age, with lives comparable to pre WWI era. They might have cellphone connectivity and mobile phones, but their lives have largely not changed in the past hundred years, not by much anyway.

I see lot of Indians complaining on the lack of civic sense amongst Indians. A lot of Indians, even city dwellers DO NOT know how to use a Western Cubicle to do their business. We see on gutka stains on the walls of public buildings or walls. We see garbage thrown on the streets (garbage segregation?! What’s that?). Open defecation is still a thing. Poor driving discipline. All of this is to be blamed on us not reaching the 21st century yet. We are hundreds of years behind. 

Social change in the west, with movements such as feminism, human rights and equality rode on the back economic improvements powered by the Industrial Revolution. People in India either forget, or are simply not aware that India has not yet reached 21st century levels of industrialization. So even, socially, we remain a backward country with poor regard for women’s rights or human rights.

Even our democracy hasn’t reached 21st century standards because of this reason. We have a GDP per capita around the 2000$ range, with 800 million dependent on govt ration to feed themselves. Putting people behind bars without a trial, and keeping them there for years is totally okay with the morals of  70% rural population and a big chunk of city dwellers are immigrants from rural areas. Not tolerating criticism and always having your sentiments hurt is also a symptom of being an underdeveloped nation. Just look at the way the laws are framed in this country, it resembles less like a developed democratic country and more similar to some autocratic regime. Free speech is a joke in this country. Innocent until proven guilty is a joke in the country. Justice delivery is a joke. Indian police procedure is a joke!

The Indian middle class which has slogged all its life studying for competitive exams and lives in broken cities with falling bridges, airports and hoardings, while traversing through flooded and pot hole infested roads basically does government charity for 5-6 months of a year. Majority of tax is generated by them in these cities and all of that goes in subsidizing the lives of farmers and rural folk who don’t know what modern farming is, stubbornly refuse to listen to learned minds and are a perennial loss making venture, and default on all their loans only for the govt to waive it off, all at the expense of the TAXPAYER. They resist any kind of farm reform, and their resistance is violent sometimes, and keep increasing their demands for subsidies and keep demanding the govt buy their shitty produce at a price that they set with no regard for market forces. Some idealistic middle class city dwellers call them “annadattas” and support them but they’re so brain dead cos they don’t realize that the failure of farmers to adopt modern farming is making their lives more expensive cos the govt has to extract the money from somewhere and it just so happens that the middle class is the most dependable cash cow.

The politicians can’t do much no matter who it is, because they’ve to cater to 70% ignorant, uneducated people from the 17th century. Not to mention staggering levels of corruption at all levels of industry and government. I expect nothing more from a 2000$ GDP per capita country. 

If you realize this one truth about India, you will pack your bags and make for greener pastures. Cos ain’t nobody got hundreds of years to wait for India to become developed. Btw, it is getting harder and harder to move to a developed country. While we still live in agricultural age, with primitive tools, developed countries are moving to the artificial intelligence age. 


TLDR ; India is a pre industrial primitive agricultural country. It is improper to expect 21st century standards of life from a country where huge populations live like it’s the 17th century. The dignity of life, civic sense, consciousness of democratic rights, freedom of speech, fair justice system, humane police procedures etc are too utopian for common Indian to access. It’ll take hundreds, if not thousands of years to achieve current western standards of life, dignity and democracy. Those who can leave, should leave for greener pastures.",1027,0.87,269,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1e4ujew/the_one_truth_that_can_explain_everything_wrong/,Poetic_dr,2024-07-16 17:28:35
1cxsltz,India,corruption India,"We didn't live up to our potential as a country, I am not sure where we went wrong tho!","I have few friends studying medicine in China and these people left India even though they had great colleges which people desire for here in India. 
I talk to them regularly and they are filled with praise for China, they love the infrastructure, THEY LOVE Shenzhen! and they send me photos of Shenzhen and other cities which leaves me in awe! The streets look clean, the infra is good (not everywhere but in Metro cities) and the education quality is pretty freaking awesome, they libraries are to die for! and much more! 

Now, I am not fond of the CCP, to put it mildly, but I can't brush off the fact that they have pulled many of their citizens out of poverty and have created greater prosperity for them! When I look at China I get jealous, I feel like that could have been us. 

We have everything, better relations with the West (relatively), English speaking population, English as a medium of education, and connection to important waterways and we had a democracy and we were not fully communist, yet I see countries like Vietnam and China outperforming us in some key metrics and I don't know what to make of it!  I am not a supporter of BJP but I agree with the BJP when they say Congress has much to answer for (although they haven't been great at bringing prosperity to India  either).
So, what happened guys?

Again, I want to reiterate, I am not a fan of the CCP, I know how China's culture changed after they took power. I have seen my cousins and friends be really desperate to go abroad and I don't like that we don't have much opportunities here in our own country. Many Chinese who go to work abroad actually come back willfully and try and help build their country up by the expertise they have gained in their host countries, I feel like it's not the same here in our country, people usually study abroad because they don't want to come back.

edit: I haven't gotten any great answers, but from what I have gathered it has something to do with 
1. Not liberalizing our economy sooner. 
2. Trying to maintain strategic autonomy of one's own country by not aligning with either superpower (again, this is good, but a balance has to be struck between economy and strategic autonomy)
3. Corruption
4. Lack of Quality Education
5. Tribal mindset: We're too divided among ourselves into sects, castes, religions, and races. Unlike us, China has a monotonous population

1bxdmfx,India,unemployment India,I don't feel optimistic about the future anymore,"I understand this may come off as whiny, as I genuinely don't have a solution, but I feel extremely let down by the current state of our country. More precisely, the employment crisis (at least that's what it looks like to me) that's been haunting college freshers / young professionals for a while now.

For context, I graduated from one of the best colleges in India (non-engineering) and landed a pretty solid job (campus placement), which is already far better than 95% of institutes - both undergrad and grad. But since there are basically no employee laws that protect you from exploitation / help with better work life balance, I was burnt out in a year. I tried another role, but did not resonate with that either. Besides, I was living in an HCOL area, and was spending most of my paycheck on rent, utilities, food, cabs, etc., all while breathing the shittiest air that has probably already reduced my life span by a decade. I had no time to work out, was commuting 2+ hrs a day, eating crap food, you get the whole shebang. I decided to take a career break and moved back home to study for master's. Well, that didn't work out as I had hoped. It was a niche program and I couldn't get in. Again, thousands of people trying for 50-60 seats.

Back to job hunting while I prep for another attempt? What a nightmare! There are hundreds of applicants even for super low paying roles. No options in non-metro cities, even though they are choked now. Barely get a response from most openings (pretty sure most are ghost jobs). Everyone wants 5+ years of work ex even for entry level roles. I kept internalizing it, thinking my skills aren't good enough and whatnot, but that's just not true, it it?

I read the ILO report that basically says educated Indians are more likely to be unemployed, and 80+% of unemployed folks are younger people. It's not about our college or skills, there just isn't enough demand anymore. The problem will worsen over time, and our govt. is barely doing anything to address it (before you come at me saying the govt. can't solve this, do your research - we can argue this later). I can afford to take a break, but I know many who can't. How can I help myself and others here? How do I stay optimistic? 

TLDR: The job / education market is terrible, whether you have one or not. Not enough jobs for educated college grads (even tier 1, can't imagine how bad it is for others). We continue to internalize it, don't realise it's a systemic problem.

But it appears not, Again I don't know every detail of the matter but From what I gathered it was all over a hug with a Muslim.. really? A Hindu... Hugged.. a ... Muslim.

Munawar faruqi may be a bad person or not idk really, I have only seen few of his standup videos and appears like a cool guy. But is the general public so fucking stupid to judge a person by just 
Munawar = Muslim = Bad
At the time I don't think  Elvish would've even thought of his religion, it was all in sportsman spirit... And ik he got his votes on the basis of Hindu samaj apparently and bla bla.

But are the people so fucking retarded as to give death threats for a Hindu hugging a Muslim.
These people have serious identitiy issues, don't have anything else in life to associate or  make themselves unique by... So they resort to hiding behind HINDU SAMAJ and making that their identity. Just gives small cock energy.

If someone could explain the psycology behind these people's mentality, you're welcome. It's okay to defend your religion but this is just wayy too fucking much.
I  know many Hindus who are very good people, understand their religion, the gods, their morals and values and practice religion accordingly. And they don't go around shouting ""Jai Shri Ram"" like it's a warcry.

And I don't like to comment on these issues even though it's so fucking stupid, because the people on some social media sites donot know how to have civilized discussions, though I invite you to comment your views here.. as long as it's civilized:)

But I think it's all the work of Godi media and the Supreme Leader himself. 
Absolute masters at giving room temp IQ Hindus extremists too much ego.
I understand it's a tactic to get votes, since Hindus are the majority in India. But goddamn, do these retarded Hindu extremists who shout not realise  that theyre literally just a votebank. A fucking 10 year old could understand what is happening and yet these people don't. I think this is all because of the state of unemployment. I can't comment on the issue because I'm not literate enough to understand the complicated economics behind providing universal employment, but just how openly mudizi is promiting Hindu nation is just fucking stupid.
I know Hindustan = Hindu sthan bla bla 
But you can't make that argument and then call yourself a developed nation.

To reiterate I don't support the opposition either, I don't know much about politics at all, but just think how dire the situation is when someone  who dint care about politics is infuriated by this.
Godi media is an absolute ass for spreading This Hindu Muslim communal war propoganda.
They do anything so that they can lick More of mudiji's ass. I don't think any reasonably intelligent person would fall for this.let alone complete adults, yet, here we are.

1aw5qg0,India,MSP farmers,"As economists and agricultural experts endorse the MSP law, will the liberals take heed of the farmer's plight against propaganda?","Legal Guarantee of MSP Is An Idea Whose Time Has Come

On 13 February 2024, over two years after the 2020-21 Farmers Movement was suspended, farmers prepared to march towards the Delhi for their long-standing demands, including the legal guarantee of MSP. Samyukta Kisan Morcha had already called for a Rural Shutdown on February 16, after holding district level protests on 26 January, and Mazdoor-Kisan Mahapadav on 26-27-28 November 2023. 

Yet, in a replay of the 2020-21 Farmer's Movement, the administration dug trenches and erected layers of barricade and barbed wires to prevent the farmers from protesting in Delhi. The police used tear gas, pellet guns, and sonic weapons against the farmers. Drones were used to drop tear gas on the farmers.

Meanwhile, the government suspended the social media accounts of farmer's leader and journalists covering the protests. The Government and the godi media launched a wave of propaganda against the farmers. The Government began sending notes to media houses claiming that the demand of MSP law is infeasible. News articles were published, quoting anonymous sources, that such a law would cost ₹10 lakh crore to the exchequer, would be larger than the infrastructure budget, would bankrupt the nation, etc. Consent began to be manufactured among the public that the demand of MSP law is a grave sin, demanded by anti-national, khalistani, farmers. Even the liberal elite began to openly support this baseless claims. Many began justifying the use of force against the protesting farmers.

The arguments and the claims against MSP, however, are disingenuous, and lack a proper understanding of agricultural or economic policy. To understand this, we need to understand the policy of MSP, and the labour economy of India.

In India, nearly half of the total workforce is engaged in agriculture and allied activities. Of this, less than 0.5% of the farmers are large farmers. Over 13% of the farmers are medium farmers, and nearly 87% are small and marginal farmers. A vast majority of the people are also landless farmers and farm labourers. Income of the farmers has been stagnant for decades, and even declined. The harvest is prone to crop failures and price fluctuations. 

For a vast majority of the farmers, increasingly with time, agriculture isn't able provide a survival livelihood. With falling incomes and rising costs, farmers are pushed into debt and dying by suicide. In states like Bihar, small farmers have migrated to other states, leaving the agriculture to women. Others have to take up labour jobs to supplement their meagre income.

At the same time, manufacturing jobs are declining, and workers are returning to the farms. Agriculture serves as a safety net for the crores of people, who have fallen aside from the unequal development. Farmers are working in the fields because they have no alternative. To suggest a transition from agriculture to manufacturing without creating jobs in the manufacturing sector is absurd.

It is also important to note, that agriculture has a high Growth Elasticity of Poverty, and an investment in agriculture can improve the lives and livelihood of crores of people in India.

Government of India declares MSP for 23 crops based on the cost of cultivation estimates made by CACP. The MSP is calculated based on A2+FL cost, against the C2 cost recommended by Swaminathan Commission. In practice, though, MSP is only realized for rice and wheat crops, and only where APMC mandis are present. Hence, for the farmers in Bihar, where APMC law was repealed, MSP exists only on paper. Even where APMC mandis are available, farmers are forced to cultivate only rice and wheat, since they can get assured price for these crops.

A legal guarantee of MSP does not mean that the Government would procure the entire harvest. Nor is the procured harvest is a lost amount, since it supports the food security programs.

A legal guarantee of MSP is a protection against exploitation for the small farmers. It is a policy against the price fluctuations inherent in the cobweb model. It is the price of the produce determined by the labour theory. MSP is the right of the farmers, just like minimum wages is for the workers or maximum retail price is for the consumers.

**A legal guarantee of MSP will ensure that farmers across the nation can get a minimum assured price for their produce, and not be exploited. It will benefit the farmers of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where MSP remains on paper, more than the farmers of Punjab and Haryana. It will also allow the farmers of Punjab and Haryana, the states which are facing soil degradation and groundwater depletion, to diversify their cropping pattern.**

**More importantly, it will directly benefit crores of farmers across India. It will bring prosperity to the rural areas. It will prevent the migration crisis. It will prevent farmer's suicides.**

CRISIL Market Intelligence & Analytics estimates that the a legal guarantee of MSP for 2023 Marketing Year would cost ₹21,000 crore, less than 0.5% of the Union Budget. It is noteworthy, that in the last five years, agriculture budget has declined from 5.44% of the total budget to 3.08% of the total budget.

MSP as a legal guarantee has been recommended by agricultural experts, economists. It has been a demand of the farmers for decades. It was recommended by Swaminathan Commission and, in 2011, was recommended by a panel led by then CM of Gujarat Narendra Modi.

It was one of the two key demands of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, a platform of over 200 farmer's unions and organizations. Farmers had organized numerous marches and protests for the demand of MSP. It was also one of the six demands during the 2020-21 Farmer's Movement, and one of the assurances given by the farmers by the Union Government. SKM continued raising the demand of MSP after the suspension of farmer's movement.

1aqg77b,India,MSP farmers,Are Farm protest demands unrealistic?,"TLDR: I have been through the demands of Farmers and to me they seem impossible to fulfill. 

C2+50% and legal guarantee: My father spent his entire life in the agriculture sector ( first govt job and then farming) and from his experience, I can say this is impossible. 
C1 is the direct cost of production and C2 is the indirect cost -> MSP is (C1+C2) *1.5. This formula is derived from the standpoint of input alone it does not consider the quality of the product and market forces. Now the second part is only govt i.e. NAFED purchases at MSP and that too essential grains and pulses. Rest is purchased by traders and that is usually determined by market forces and that price can range from 0.5x to 2x. For perishables, it can range from 0 – 10x.  With NAFED then the farmers are reluctant to take any risk. The thing about NAFED is region there is a quota and the window opens typically in the harvest season and closes once the quota is fulfilled. Now 
What happens when MSP is enforced on traders? They would purchase only on a need-basis and the rest would be imported. The net outcome is that market supply will drop down significantly over the demand, meaning hyperinflation and unsold inventory with the farmer. Now account for lower purchases due to quality issues and the prices of all food items would typically become 3-5x of the current prices. The biggest beneficiary will be the importer and an agrarian state like India will be import-dependent on food. 
Now coming to the 50% profit part (which is tax-free), most traditional industries (steel, cement, transport, etc.) operate on a margin of ~5% and ~50% of their income is taken by the govt as tax.
 
Withdrawal from WTO: Now since this logic of global prices has been put forth in front of farmers the reason, we cannot put restrictions on imports that farmer organizations have demanded for the govt to withdraw from WTO so that domestic prices are not affected by global markets and there would be no restrictions on subsidies. So basically 1.5x the selling price at 0 input cost. 
 
Restriction of corporate sectors into agriculture: The govt has limitations on how much it can invest into agricultural reform and only the corporate sector can bring investment that can scale up to the entire landscape of India. 
 
Pension for farmers: Here some of the state govt is unable to pay existing employees' pensions, Infrastructure development is done on borrowed money, now add the cost of excess MSP from 1st point pension money. From where will the money come for farmers?
 
Withdraw Electricity Amendment Bill: Now the thing is with privatization the cost of electricity may increase. So no privatization of electricity. Most state electricity boards are putting the state finances towards bankruptcy and there is no way this can be sustainable. 
 
None of the demand seems to be realistic.

1aqd3uf,India,MSP farmers,When Farmers Stood Up,"**Part 1: When Farmers Stood Up**

In 2014, Narendra Modi came to power with the promise of MSP at C2+50% for the farmers, and ending the agricultural crisis in India. As CM, Modi had recommended a legal guarantee of MSP, and promised pension for farmers in his manifesto for 2014 General Election. Yet, the farmers were betrayed. The budget allocation to agriculture fell, and agricultural growth slowed down. The Government made it difficult to declare droughts. Agricultural income fell and indebtedness increased. Meanwhile, the Government kept on repeating the promise of doubling farmer's income, without even a concrete plan or policy.

In 2017, the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government in Madhya Pradesh shot dead 6 farmers who were protesting for their demands. To fight against the growing attacks on the farmers, farm organizations and unions united under the banner All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).

AIKSCC had two key demands. First, a legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) using the comprehensive cost formula as recommended by Swaminathan Commission. Second, freedom from indebtedness, through a one-time comprehensive loan waiver, to end the farmer's suicides. AIKSCC led numerous protests and long marches for the fulfilment of these demands, which were conveniently ignored by the Government.

On 5 June 2020, when India was reeling under the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modi Government used this crisis as an opportunity (aapada me awasar) to bring three farm laws as an ordinance. These laws, related to APMC mandi, contract farming, and hoarding of grains, were brought in a conspiracy with corporates, to allow a corporate takeover of agriculture and drive farmers off their land.

At this time, agriculture in India was already going through a crisis. Due to falling incomes and increasing debt, farmers were dying by suicide. Farmers had organized numerous protests and march against the anti-farmer policies. These protests were forcefully crushed by the Government and ignored by the mainstream media.

AIKSCC wrote to the Prime Minister against the three ordinances, and organized protests throughout July and August. Yet, these pleas fell on deaf ears. Meanwhile, protests against the three ordinances intensified in Punjab and Haryana. AIKSCC gave the call of “Delhi Chalo” on 26-27 November 2020. This was supposed to be a two-day protest.

Yet, even before the march began, several farm leaders were detained and put under house arrest. The Government dug trenches on the borders of Delhi, and put nails and barbed wires. Tear gas and water cannons were used to prevent the farmers from reaching the capital, and protest in Ramlila Maidan.

The farmers decided to sit in protest and camped where they could. To coordinate their protest, farm unions formed the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM). The two-day protest of farmers turned into a 12-month long nationwide movement. Throughout the freezing winter and scorching summer, lakhs of farmers sat in protests at the borders of Delhi, while an intense and widespread movement spread across India.

After initially refusing to talk to the farmers, the Government held 11 rounds of talks with the SKM. SKM had settled on a list of six demands, which included the repeal of the three farm laws and the legal guarantee of MSP.

The Government used all kinds of measures to crush the movement. The government and its propaganda media, tried to castigate the protesters by calling them Pakistani, Khalistani, Naxalite, Maoist, and Andolanjeevi. BJP sent its goons to attack the protest sites and provoke the protesters, while police stayed as a mute spectator. Numerous cases were filed against the farmers. Nearly 800 farmers died during the protests. In Lakhimpur Kheri, Ashish Mishra Teni, son of a BJP minister, mowed down six farmers to their death. In spite of all oppression, the farmers remained resolute, and their non-violent movement persisted.

On 19 November 2021, PM Modi announced to repeal the three laws. Yet, other demands were still pending. Farmers had led a year-long movement, but were only back to the situation which existed before June 2020.

Further deliberations took place between the SKM and the Government. On 9 December 2021, Sanjay Agarwal, Secretary of Department of Agriculture and Farmer's Welfare, gave a written assurance to the farmers, with a list of five promises, including a legal guarantee of MSP, withdrawal of cases registered against the farmer, compensation to the martyrs of the movement, and urged them to suspend their movement. The Farmer's Movement was suspended on 11 December 2021.",0,0.41,18,https://i.redd.it/jpx3pn520hic1.jpeg,rishianand,2024-02-14 03:28:54
1bjemsm,India,MSP farmers,I hate Rahul Gandhi and hopes he never comes to power,"I had my fair share of problems with the BJP government and their casteist policies, but there seems to be no other option than them. Congress is smoking some serious shit.

I mean what is this, seriously what the heck is this?

I come from a general middle class family, my entire family pays taxes, insane amount of taxes. And congress is just showing me a middle finger. We are talking here about removing reservation and congress wants to remove 50% cap, I mean what am I supposed to do, commit suicide? I mean I am not rich enough to pay those private institutes... and I am not poor enough either to fall in their freebies scheme.

No talk of infrastructure, No talk of corruption, No talk to end monopoly of certain companies, No talk of Women Safety in terms of harassment, No talk of making India a manufacturing Hub. No Talk of High Quality Education... Nothing.

And who is gonna pay for all of this, I mean do they think we can just print infinite amount of money or something. Rahul gandhi has to be the dumbest guy in politics...

He is talking debt relief, he is talking about MSP, who is gonna pay for life and accident insurance, who is gonna pay for the new 30 lakh government employees salary... \[There are around 30 lakh government employees, as of today\]. He is talking about doubling that number.  


This is bankrupting your own country speedrun. This is gonna raise inflation, reduce GDP growth rate and gonna drive companies from setting up plants in India.

1ebrsn7,India,MSP farmers,"Dialogues on Socialism | Agricultural Crisis in India and the Farmer's Movement | A Discussion with Dr Ashok Dhawale | July 25, 2024","**“Dialogues on Socialism” is a series of weekly video conferences, addressed by prominent activists and intellectuals of India, to develop a socialist understanding of the Indian politics.**

The 10 years of Modi Raj witnessed a worsening agricultural crisis in India. Against the promise of doubling the farmer's income by 2022, the agricultural income fell in real terms. Meanwhile, the indebtedness increased by over 50%. The budget allocation to agriculture was slashed, and agricultural growth fell.

In 2014, Narendra Modi had come to power with the promise of ending the agricultural crisis in India and the implementation of Swaminathan Commission report on minimum support price. As CM, Modi had recommended a legal guarantee of MSP, and promised pension for farmers in his manifesto for 2014 General Election. Yet, his Government reneged on these promises.

In 2016, the BJP Government introduced a new crop insurance policy, which allowed huge profits for the insurance companies. Meanwhile, the Government changed the drought policy, which made it difficult to declare droughts and provide compensation to the farmers. According to NCRB report, every hour one farmer/farm-labourer dies by suicide.

On 5 June 2020, when the nation was under the COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdown, Modi Government brought three farm laws — related to APMC markets, contract farming, and hoarding of agricultural produce — as an ordinance. These laws were brought in collusion with the corporates and were against the interests of the farmers. No farm organisations or unions were consulted for these laws. Farmers, under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), fought a historic struggle and compelled the Modi Government to withdraw the three black laws. Over 700 farmers died in this year-long struggle. The movement was suspended after a written assurance by the Union Government to the farmers. These assurances remain unfulfilled.

As the agricultural crisis continues to worsen, and the Government remains indifferent, farmers, under the banner of SKM, gear up for a renewed movement for their unfulfilled demands.

*Dr Ashok Dhawale is the President of the All India Kisan Sabha and a leader of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha. He is the author of the book on the historic farmers struggle in India, titled “When Farmers Stood Up”. He is also a Politburo member of CPI(M).*

1bs6tr6,India,MSP farmers,Yellow Revolution Idea for Punjab,"Punjab needs to facilitate India in a Yellow Revolution (Protein Revolution). By growing more protein-rich crops which are then procured by the government for further processing into refined protein powder. The government should provide MSP for such crops. This will push farmers away from traditional water-consuming rice crops. 

Some budding food processing enterprises should be given seed funds and contracts for procurement by the govt to hold 30% of their firms. Punjab needs to plan a new 100k population township in each district which will consist of boarding schools (capacity 60-70k primary and secondary school students), hostels, teachers' residences (2-5k), and drug rehab centres. These schools will get protein powder supplies from the mentioned enterprises which will be provided to the students and rehab patients. The idea is to provide holistic growth development for students by taking care of their nutrients at an early stage of their lives. 35% of India below 18 is malnourished. 80% of children don't get adequate protein and other nutrition. These schools will have all kinds of sports, and recreation facilities. 

There will be 1 such town in each district. The teachers should be given 30% ownership of the homes if they complete 5 yrs in such schools. Auction of the residential units to interested staff (only up to 51% ownership) after 10 years to generate more funds if the township flourishes post-immigration of teachers and other staff.

This is morally wrong at many levels he is just trying to please his andhbhakts at this point because no educated person with atleast a single brain cell will support or endorse what modi said. And this isn't new about modi he bought votes in the name of pulwama attack victims during his 2019 campaign and is buying vote in the name of hindu muslim communal anger this time.  I do not support congress but this guy does not deserve to be the PM of India, he has been feeding the poison of hindu muslim for 10 years now which has getting increasingly worse.

**THE MEDIA IS FINISHED AND BURIED.**

What even is their to talk about media in the last few years everyday there is atleast one show by them on hindu muslim/mandir masjid/ or how india will become a hindu rashtra. This propaganda is fueled by the few cases of muslims attacking hindus gathered by them one such incident is milked by them for months just mindwashing people at whole another level. The media which should be the 4th pillar is nothing but a medium of spreading hate btw the north korean television also runs hate television and radio channels against south korea and America while  praising their supreme leader. 

  
**THE STUPID BABAS.**

One of the ways of spreading this poison is through so called babas who claim to be able to talk to god and do tricks to impress the people for example the Bhageshwar baba. He openly said that hindus should raise weapons against muslims what level of hate speech other than this be. And the stupid politicians who endorse this babas who spread misinformation, hatred and superstition is just mind boggling. And i am not saying muslims haven't done bad thing to hindus but are hindus washed in milk.? There are rotten apples on both sides and that's how the world works there are good people and their are bad people. A religion can never make a person good or bad. I have had many muslim friends during my school even my best friend was muslim I never felt any hatred from him or his family for being a hindu. If you take a few people for the benchmark of any religion then you are nothing but a brainwashed fool

Observe minutely the structures in the marketed image and notice the difference with real one.

I know it is still unfinished, and both above pictures have different angles, but in the actual one, it sure looks like they have made some temporary tall structures(which are lighter in color than the finished structure and look architecturally low-quality) so that the temple looks more 'finished' than it actually is. Which makes the entire celebration even more shady.

1atypv1,India,Ram Mandir,What has happened to this country.,"This might be a big post so i will put it in points.

1)India has literally become impossible to criticize for some reason. People will say anything to defend their beliefs instead of challenging them and learning. Any criticism is portrayed as hate for some reason and just to pretend that they are actually open minded they always say ""India has a lot of problems but this is just hate"" or some variation. This is okay if you are actually thinking about India's problems and are only against those that hate India (Like ""All Indians are stupid"") but all criticism is considered hate nowadays.

2)Why is there suddenly so much hate against literally anybody not a Hindu. Wasn't our country based on the values of secularism and loving other religions people like our brothers and sisters. Doesn't our pledge literally state ""All Indians are my brothers and sisters "". On Christmas in the st Thomas school's church there were very peaceful celebrations, not interrupting anyone or anything but for some reason some people decided to show up outside the church and started singing Kirtans and selling Ramayans and stuff, totally interrupting the celebration going on peacefully. Nobody interrupted holi or diwali so why was christmas interrupted. Why? Also why was ram mandir created? Yeah sure the mandir was destroyed but hindu rulers destroyed many religious places too  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion\_of\_non-Hindu\_places\_of\_worship\_into\_temples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_non-Hindu_places_of_worship_into_temples) . Why was the creation of ram Mandir allowed when a) we have done the literal same thing b) Our own constitution tells us not to do it. I can see no good argument to go against our own values like this. Hinduism was supposed to be the most tolerant religion wasn't it.

I can add so much more but this is enough for today, I might make another post tomorrow or later. If you have counterpoints please share in the comments.",715,0.75,455,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1atypv1/what_has_happened_to_this_country/,Lifelonglearner12345,2024-02-18 16:58:23

19e4dxs,India,Ram Mandir,Question for those that support/like the Ram Mandir: What does it mean to you?,"A lot of people I knew in the past and follow on social media have been 'celebrating' the consecration of the Ram Mandir, something I am ideologically opposed to. I'm not entirely surprised, but I'm finding it harder to process because while it's clearly a political event, they don't seem to see it as such.

So, if you felt good about the ceremony on 22nd January, and celebrated it, what did it mean to you? Is it just a slightly more orange Diwali or something else?

Do you think the demolition of the Babri Masjid was a good thing? If not, how do you reconcile feeling good about the Mandir built on it? 

Some factual ground rules we can follow (You can dispute this but it would be hard to):

1. The destruction of the Babri Masjid was illegal and happened while India was an independent secular constitutional democracy, if an illegal act did not occur, it would still be there.
2. The Ram Janmbhoomi movement was a political move by the BJP, and did result in a great deal of communal strife and violence and contributed to enmity between Hindus and Muslims, which the BJP benefits from to this day.
3. The Prime Minister of India could have been in attendance, but to be the one leading the consecration ceremony is wrong. He is the leader of a secular democracy and should not be performing the duties of a religious leader. Any number of great Hindu priests could have done this in his stead.",0,0.4,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/19e4dxs/question_for_those_that_supportlike_the_ram/,icedlong,2024-01-24 00:59:50

1anhaxj,India,Ram Mandir,Discussion - How would Vivekananda view the Ramjanmabhoomi movement and Ram Mandir?,"Actual Article : [https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/ram-temple-construction-vivekananda-hinduism/article67793306.ece](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/ram-temple-construction-vivekananda-hinduism/article67793306.ece)

Recently, I came across an article in Frontline about Vivekananda's hypothetical perspective of Ramjanmabhoomi movement. I should state that I have never read Swami Vivekananda before and this post has lot of his words quoted which seemed like a breath of fresh air. One quote that really resonated with me is below:

>Asked in an interview by an American reporter what exactly about religion he was teaching, Vivekananda replied, “It is really the  philosophy of religion, the kernel of all its outward forms. All forms  of religion have an essential and a non-essential part. If we strip from them the latter, there remains the real basis of all religion, which  all forms of religion possess in common. Unity is behind them all. We  may call it God, Allah, Jehovah, the Spirit, Love; it is the same unity  that animates all life, from its lowest form to its noblest  manifestation in man. It is on this unity that we need to lay stress,  whereas… it is on the non-essential that men are apt to lay stress. They  will fight and kill each other for these forms, to make their fellows  conform. Seeing that the essential is love of God and love of man, this  is curious, to say the least.”

I would like to know from the people who have read Vivekananda about their opinion on this article. Does author represents Vivekananda correctly? Also, please suggest me some of his readings.

19dyvzi,India,Ram Mandir,Ram mandir is built on human sacrifice,"I hear colleagues of mine cellebrating this event, it should be a auspicious occasion but I just feel uncomfortable. I understand the arguments that it could be the birth place of ram (ambiguity since none alive knows for sure, but the archeological survey by asi did say it existed, but there seems to be opinions against that as well). But my topic is not about the validity or cause. I have no issues with ram mandir being built. I love that something cool to see is being built that might bring monetary gains to this country and satisfy religious needs.

 But, I absolutely lothe the way it was built. On the lives of Hindus and Muslims. On blood. By destruction, lack of 

I agree that most religious places of worship were built on blood. But should it be built like that. Today, when discourse should be our means of resolution. I suppose this is idealistic, 

But t a nation is built on ideals. You can take away its money, it's resources but it would still be that nation. Take away its ideals it will cease to be

I hope that no God would appreciate a temple built on violence. Because if they did, the monsters that massacred millions in the past would be rewarded.

19d0jrx,India,Ram Mandir,Ram is returning after 500 years?,"Congratulations to everyone for the Ram Mandir!  Hurray!

Being in my 40's I have so many questions and concerns about current and future state of our country.  I was a child in the 90's and grew up in a very happy and optimistic India, our group had Hindu and Muslims friends, caste wasn't in the front and center either.  2000's I believe was the most optimistic but things have gone south since then.  The current state is concerning and future is scary.

Now, why is Ram coming back after 500 years? What is that all about?  In Bharat, the land of Gods with Millions of temples everywhere why is the Ram Mandir the only Mandir that concerns Ram?  Saying Ram is coming back after 500 years makes it seem like he wasn't there for 500 years.  It makes us Hindus look super weak with inferiority complex.  For 500 years we could not build a mandir for Ram?  And now only our lord saviour Modiji is able to do it after 500 years?  Then I realized for 500 years apparently we are hell bent on building a mandir on top of a specific mosque for 500 years. Really? Are we that insecure?  Do we have GPS coordinates written somewhere about the exact pin point for Ram's birth.  Why do we have to assert that Ram Janmabhoomi is literally in the mosque.  Entire Bharat is Ram's Janmabhoomi.  Mandir could have been built anywhere in Ayodhya and devotees would have flocked to it.  People celebrating saying Ram is coming back after 500 years think they are celebrating a milestone but to me it looks like they are pointing to some big time failure.  Failure being some Hindus being hell bent on building temple on top of a mosque.  And spirit of Ram and religion has given way to the spirit of jingoism and chest thumping, being loud and in your face.

Foreign new channels on youtube and other foreign videos are calling it ""Controversial temple inauguration build over a recently demolished centuries old mosque"".  And some idiots on all these videos are commenting.  ""Biased reporting"".  ""Correction: There was already a temple under the mosque"".  Are we lacking such basic education and critical thinking and common sense that we are equating what kings and rulers, invaders or not, did centuries ago to what we are doing as the ""world's largest democracy""?  That's literally what a monarchy and kingdom means.. Kings did whatever the hell they wanted.  All I wanted to say is all the safronization and jingoism makes us looks super weak.  I just saw another post on Reddit saying ""I blame Islam for radicalization of Hinduism"" - this is what the current state is.  We are weak, we have waited 500 years for Ram to come back and we have radicalized ourselves because of Islam.  My head hurts.  Good luck India.

1cn0qvv,India,Bharat Jodo Yatra,Rahul Gandhi And Fighting A Political Battle On One's Own Terms,"On 22 January 2024, as Prime Minister set out for Ram Mandir Consecration, the ruling party used entire state, media, and political apparatus to turn the religious even into a political campaign. His propaganda media hailed it as a ""renaissance"", a ""historic day"", a beginning of Ram Rashtra. The Union Government Cabinet hailed it as a true freedom, undermining the long fought freedom of 1947. The propaganda media was particularly scathing in its attacks on Congress for turning down the invitation.

At the same time, Rahul Gandhi was travelling across the country meeting lakhs of common people in his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. The Yatra was also heavily derided by many. Yet, the former Congress President stayed on his course, refusing to follow the communal politics and raising the issues of livelihood and justice.

Nyay or Justice became the watchword of the two Yatras that spanned the length and breadth of the India. Throughout the Yatras, Rahul Gandhi continued to meet thousands of Youths, Workers, Farmers, and the marginalised classes.

At the same time, Congress was hit by a series of defections, dwindling funds, and immense pressure from a media which had declared the elections a foregone conclusion, and the politics of Hindutva an undeniable fact. Yet, Congress refused to tow their agenda.

In April, Congress unveiled its Election Manifesto with a focus on Youth, Women, Workers, Farmers, and the Backward Classes. For a nation reeling under crises of unemployment, inequality, and injustice, Congress' pro-people plank was a breath of fresh air.

Unsurprisingly, in his patented style, Modi went on a communal diatribe to call Congress Manifesto as a Muslim League Manifesto. He went from rallies to rallies, alleging that Congress wants to steal women's mangalsutra, wealth, buffaloes, etc. He claimed that Congress wanted to destroy Ram Mandir. Fearing a possibility of defeat, the ruling party went further into a communal hatemongering campaign.

Yet, with Congress refusing to join its chorus, BJP stands alone and adrift. Following Congress' campaign against assault on constitution and social justice, BJP itself was forced on the backfoot. With Modi's recent comments against Adani and Ambani, one thing is certain, Rahul Gandhi has managed to force Narendra Modi to play on his terms. India has, for the time being, been saved from the political agenda of Hindutva.",83,0.89,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1cn0qvv/rahul_gandhi_and_fighting_a_political_battle_on/,rishianand,2024-05-08 09:55:57

## tl;dr

In 2023, IFF’s transparency vertical filed 64  RTI applications with various public authorities at the state and union  levels to bring transparency and accountability into the functioning of  a number of public authorities, and empower Indian citizens with  information that affects their digital rights. Some notable responses  from this quarter include a push-and-pull with MIB on comments it  received in the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023,  stonewalling of information on censorship and content blocking/takedown  orders from the government, more non-transparency into the Digi Yatra  ecosystem, the POSHAN App being non-mandatory, and more. 

## Why should you care?

The  Right to Information Act, 2005 (“RTI Act”) was enacted to promote  transparency and accountability in the working of public authorities by  ensuring that citizens are able to secure access to information in  control of these authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to  ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities  acting in private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a  value of public decision-making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it  comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.

The  RTI Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the  public to engage with, and demand transparency and accountability from,  our union and state governments. The Digital Transparency vertical at  IFF strives to routinely extract information about various ongoing  policies and projects introduced in the public sector through RTI  Applications filed under the Act. Responses we receive often pave the  way for government engagement, advocacy, and even strategic litigation.  Previous reports on our transparency endeavours can be accessed [here](https://internetfreedom.in/tag/transparency/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). 

## RTIs we filed

Here is a list of RTIs we filed this quarter:

1. On  November 23, 2023 the Department of Personnel and Training published a  notification bearing reference number G.S.R 864(E), placing the Indian  Computer Emergency Response Team (“CERT-In”) under the Second Schedule  of the RTI Act—thereby exempting it from the application of the Act. In  an attempt to have more transparency on the legislative processes  involved in notifying a public authority under this schedule, we filed 8  [RTIs](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1dLHVGrm_38RUTRhGRE0ZUOyTNvnJnrRBsgOqP9quSCA/edit?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  this quarter asking the Department for legislative process and history  of 8 exempted intelligence and security agencies (including CERT-In).  Read our statement on how exempting CERT-In from the RTI Act dilutes  institutional transparency and weakens individual privacy [here](https://internetfreedom.in/statement-exemption-of-cert-in-from-the-rti-act/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).
2. We [asked](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MP3HEr2kHW7-sAJx1bXfnhegwVxktxhU/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  the Ministry of Electronics & IT (“MeitY”) detailed questions about  the WhatsApp message sent from the ‘Viksit Bharat Sampark’ account to  millions of users, including where they got our numbers from. Read our  post decoding the message and what it means for voter privacy during the  2024 General Elections [here](https://internetfreedom.in/whatsapp-message-from-meity/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).
3. We  filed a number of RTIs on the surveillance and censorship efforts  during the Ram Temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya on January 22,  2024. We asked the Ministry of Home Affairs (“MHA”) about the [blocking](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DNLBvNRizOjFiPGI0nSS8EUOUvHEiiym/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  of 100 social media accounts ahead of the Ram Temple consecration  ceremony by MHA and real-time monitoring of social media websites by a  “cyber experts group”, and the [installation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dQoDchrb9EbFzVaCfJsYWvCQXfNnzFWK/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of “high accuracy” CCTV cameras in Ayodhya as a security measure by the UP Government.
4. We  asked MeitY and the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (“MIB”)  many questions on content censorship, takedowns, and blocking:
   1. We [asked](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kq7xGXojEd9nr0zewy8lhi-aZfF_NP4x/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) MeitY and MIB about the takedown of Bihar railway worker protest videos from YouTube.
   2. We [asked](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HiszId6hnMnFp2w-fDrw5HVe80V58uJ3/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) MeitY and MIB about the suspension of Media Swaraj channel from YouTube.
   3. We  asked MeitY and MIB about X/Twitter accounts blocked during the  Farmers’ Protests in February 2024 through 12 separate RTIs. We [maintained a tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bFxPbQ0AxQbFGbKS0nfTmylEceytH4LDxbOngiiblp0/edit?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) for these blockings and our RTIs.
   4. We asked [MeitY](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uMiynhflikXnLFIJF7YUJQgOga_nmemC/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and [MIB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmtFw7M2IejzqUfsn9kNTuY3pmkXVore/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) about the takedown of the Caravan Magazine story ‘Screams from the Army Post’.
5. We [asked](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4AlcsoF9Ah4fmTdEFl4l3LUD2X5jBWO/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) the Bengaluru Traffic Police about their pilot project where they [allegedly](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/bengaluru-techies-follow-traffic-rules-or-your-firm-will-be-notified-about-your-violations/articleshow/106043268.cms?from=mdr&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  sent information about the specific traffic violation to the violator’s  respective IT company through email or Whatsapp of the company  employees.
6. We asked about the constitution of fact-check units in Patna ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L0MKPSYntpcfxnfcpSYlEENudxJ7UBrn/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)) and Odisha ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-JUPpgJ5SBzgUZVnoVja8zTmEEAaeFEN/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)).
7. We asked many public authorities about the use of artificial intelligence in governance:

## Round-up of prominent responses 

We  tracked policy consultations, news headlines, and emerging government  schemes to make measured RTI interventions on a number of concerning  initiatives. Here are some key responses we received to our RTIs this  year, along with a summary of outcomes that emerged from them:

### The Broadcasting Bill files

In November 2023, the MIB published the [draft Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill](https://mib.gov.in/sites/default/files/Public%20Notice_0.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) for public consultation. On December 07, 2023, we submitted [our comments](https://internetfreedom.in/comments-on-the-broadcasting-bill-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on the bill, and launched the [Letuschill.in](http://letuschill.in/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  campaign, encouraging our community to also send in templatised email  responses as comments for the bill. Following this, on February 23,  2024, we [wrote a letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UBiA0S2uzKbtAU5BGTyEqxJPhCxiA1kF/view?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  to MIB requesting the publication of all received comments on the  Ministry's website, with personal information redacted. Simultaneously,  we filed an [RTI application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LTvYQ8qu9ppBGRAbbyX-Wy3Z_O3_CzM2/view?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) with MIB, seeking details and copies of the consultation responses. 

Then,  things got interesting. On March 01, 2024, MIB sent an email to us and  other stakeholders who submitted comments, saying they have received RTI  requests to disclose their comments, requesting them to give consent  for the same within 10 days. We promptly provided our consent as IFF,  and sent a mailer to our community explaining the process to them and  encouraging them to give their consent with personal details redacted,  if they so prefer. 

Thereafter, we received an [RTI response](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DOQr_y0B_vC61j0Zk2RSRRB6j_z2mq9/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  from MIB through which they made some interesting arguments. First,  they claimed that the comments submitted by stakeholders cannot be  disclosed without their consent as that would violate their privacy and  intellectual property rights. Despite this, MIB requested a sum of Rs.  934 from us to send us copies of the 417 comments it could make public.  We duly paid the sum and now await their response. Additionally,  alongside this process on March 04, 2024, [we reiterated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gZ8xaLCgo81vteW8jFdVNLAUn2Zu9CJz/view?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  the necessity of transparently sharing all consultation responses,  urging the redaction of personal details before publication. We await  movement on this and will keep you posted.

### What happens in Ayodhya…

In  our ongoing efforts to gather comprehensive information surrounding the  Ram Temple ceremony in Ayodhya on January 22, 2024, we filed 4 RTI  requests with different departments, seeking details and procedures  associated with the widespread AI-enabled surveillance and security  measures being adopted in the city (as described above). The [response](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14StpNulTviMrdYVEX55NubwW-tYSLS09/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  from the DGP, UP was particularly noteworthy, as they shared a copy of  the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) used by the UP Police during the  ceremony. This document may hold some valuable insights into the  protocols and strategies adopted by the local police—we are currently in  the process of meticulously analysing the SOP and will publish it  shortly. 

### Don’t ask, don’t tell: Censorship edition

In  all our efforts to get information on content censorship, takedowns,  and blocking across Farmers’ protests, Caravan story takedown, media  blocking and constitution of fact-check units, we got comparable  tight-lipped responses. The trifecta of Section 69A (Information  Technology Act), Rule 16 (Information Technology rules), and 8(1)(a) of  the RTI Act was used liberally in response. We await responses on some  of these and will be collating these findings in a censorship report  shortly, deeply analysing these responses and identifying trends. 

### Daastan-e-DigiYatra

We  sought information on the data ecosystem and operations of Digi Yatra  with regional airports in December 2023, but the responses lacked  information and clarity. Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports  Authority of India stated that Digi Yatra is not mandatory (though the  story on ground is [different](https://internetfreedom.in/digiyatra-kyr/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)!), and the Bengaluru International Airport Limited (“BIAL”) [stated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gxujiNq5Khwn157JhCsKojJtlTPemL8C/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  that whether BIAL is a public authority and therefore under the RTI Act  is still “sub-judice” (being decided by a court of law).

### Don’t act smart(city) with me!

Because  of the recent surge and deployment of artificial intelligence in the  public sector, especially in smart city initiatives, we filed a bunch of  RTIs with the different ministries and departments. But as usual,  received little to no information in return. IFF has built an AI/ML  tracker Transparency Tracker on the use of AI/ML in the Indian public  sector (we will make this public soon!), which goes to show the extent  of non-transparency and accountability evasion in this domain.

### POSHAN Tracker not mandatory

We  filed 3 separate RTIs with the Ministry of Women and Child Development  last year in the context of the POSHAN tracking application regarding  beneficiary concerns, Anganwadi and health worker concerns (if it is  mandatory and if they are being provided with any technical training),  collecting and tracking data of children with disabilities and asking if  there is privacy impact assessment and a cost-benefit analysis  instituted for the POSHAN app. One [response](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_dKg4zOIFh9x6Lfae3cGnmDdps-W1tL/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)  (which came many months late!) stated that the POSHAN app is not  mandatory for Anganwadi workers and that technical training of Anganwadi  workers on the app is done on a regular basis through the National  e-Governance Division and National Institute of Public Corporation and  Child Development. They also mentioned that POSHAN is not used to track  attendance, or at least mandatorily. Lastly, they noted that the privacy  impact assessment and a cost-benefit analysis are points under “active  consideration”.

### The APAAR trouble

We have filed a host of RTIs with the Ministry of Education about

 the seemingly lawless APAAR ID which is being implemented at breakneck  speed across India, only to receive mind-numbing responses. We will soon  release a detailed analysis of our transparency efforts around APAAR in  a separate post.

### ECI’s big secret?

We filed an RTI with the Election Commission of India (“ECI”) regarding the partnership between the ECI and technology provider [Staqu Technologies Pvt. Ltd](https://www.staqu.com/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) (Staqu). In the [response](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aScYiw9TDm_M5k_JbnkfTTWo_QCF0Dyy/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in), the PIO disposed of this RTI vide the impugned response stating that the “*Election  Commission of India has not been partnership or engaged with M/s Staqu  Technologies Pvt. Ltd.(Staqu) for voter awareness related activities*”.  We are planning to file a first appeal as the information given was  inadequate and incomplete. In the RTI, the information sought was for  all and any partnerships between the ECI and Staqu Technologies Pvt.  Ltd. and is not limited to only “voter awareness activities” to which  the ECI has responded. 

## So, what’s next?

Well,  we shall continue to track the news and file pertinent RTI requests,  and keep fighting the good fight for transparent, accountable, and  citizen-led democratic institutions. We look forward to receiving  responses to the remaining RTIs and will keep you updated in our next  quarterly report, so stay tuned!

## tl;dr

Both houses of the Parliament were adjourned  sine die on February 10, 2024, concluding the 2024 Budget Session one  day after the scheduled end date of February 09, and the last  parliamentary session for the 17th Lok Sabha. During this Session, 10  new bills were introduced for passing, of which 12 were passed by both  houses, 1 pending passage in the Rajya Sabha, with a total of 24 bills  pending after the conclusion of the session. The Union Interim Budget  for 2024-25 was presented and passed. We see increased budgetary  allocations in the budget for MeitY, MHA, MIB and DoT as compared to the  2023-2024 Budget, which is a good starting point for building and  implementing robust digital systems. Discussions on the floor of the  parliament spanned several issues, including those relevant to digital  rights and freedoms.

## Background

The 15th  Parliamentary Session of the 17th Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die on  February 10, 2024, concluding one day after the scheduled end date of  February 09. This marks the last parliamentary sitting for the 17th Lok  Sabha, as we prepare to elect a new government in the upcoming general  elections. In the session, Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented  the Union Interim Budget for the Financial Year (“FY”) 2024-2025, which  was passed in both houses. The budget is an interim allocation of funds  until India forms a new union government in the 2024 Lok Sabha  elections, post which a full budget will be placed in both houses for  deliberation again in July 2024. A cumulative sum of ₹1,43,337.88 Cr has  been allotted to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology  (MeitY), the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), the  Department of Telecommunications (DoT), and Ministry of Home Affairs  (MHA). See our detailed analysis of the budget for these ministries in [this blogpost](https://internetfreedom.in/budget-2024-part-ii/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

Both  houses introduced 10 bills, passed 12 and withdrew none. The bills  passed in both houses and now awaiting presidential assent include the  Finance Bill, 2024 which gives effect to tax proposals of the central  government for the year 2024-25 and 5 Appropriation Bills. The other  bills passed are the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution),  Amendment Bill, 2024, Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means)  Bill, 2024, Jammu and Kashmir Local Bodies Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024,  Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2024,  Constitution (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Orders (Amendment)  Bill, 2024, Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order  (Amendment) Bill, 2023; Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled  Tribes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2023. Read more about this session’s  legislative business [here](https://prsindia.org/files/parliament/session_track/2024/session_wrap/Session_Wrap-Budget_Session_2024.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

The  Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha observed productivity rates of 148% and 137%  respectively. However, a majority of their time (44-47%) was spent  discussing non-legislative business, and a fraction of time (8-9%)  actually went into discussing and answering questions. While the Union  Interim Budget was passed after 7 hours 6 minutes of discussion in the  Lok Sabha and 6 hours 37 minutes discussion in the Rajya Sabha, both  houses spent between 3-5 hours discussing agenda item 'Historic  construction of Shree Ram Temple and Pran Pratishta' on the final day of  the Parliament. These statistics are available [here](https://prsindia.org/sessiontrack/budget-session-2024/productivity?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and [here](https://prsindia.org/sessiontrack/budget-session-2024/important-issues?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

## Quick overview: Union Interim Budget 2024-25

Union  Interim Budget for FY 2024-25 has cumulatively allotted ₹1,43,337.88 Cr  to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), the  Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), the Department of  Telecommunications (DoT), and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). A glance  at Ministry-wise Budget Estimates (“BE”) and Revised Estimates (“RE”)  shows us that for the MeitY, allocation in BE 2024-2025 (₹21,385.15 Cr)  saw an increase of 48.28% as compared to the RE of 2023-24 (₹14,421.25  Cr); for the MHA, allocation in BE 2024-2025 (₹5733.51 crores) saw an  increase of 11.97% as compared to the RE of 2023-24 (₹5120.78 Cr), for  the MIB, allocation in BE 2024-2025 (₹4342.55 Cr) saw a decrease of  2.41% as compared to the RE of 2023-24 (₹4449.76 Cr), for the DoT,  allocation in BE 2024-2025 (₹1,11,876.67 Cr) saw an increase of 13.74%  as compared to the RE of 2023-24 (₹98,359.41 Cr).

An enormous  17.15% increase in total planned capital expenditure of DoT, MeitY, MHA,  and MIB (₹1,43,337.88 Cr) over the RE of 2023-24 (₹1,22,351.2 Cr) can  be observed, stemming largely from a 48.28% increase in the Ministry of  Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The increment can be  attributed to MeitY’s capital allocation towards the Modified Programme  for Development of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in  India, which saw a whopping 359.1% increase as compared to 2023-24.

## Ministry-wise overview

1. **MeitY:** The  total budgetary allocation for MeitY in the Budget for 2024-2025 is  ₹21385.2 Cr, which is a 29.2% increase from the previous financial  year’s budget. The increase is even higher when compared to the RE of  2023-2024, i.e., a year-on-year change of 48.28%. This is in contrast to  the budgetary trends we witnessed in 2021, 2022 and 2023, where there  was underutilisation of the budget.

&#x200B;

* **DoT**: In 2024-25, the Department  (which operates under the Ministry of Communications) has been allocated  a whopping ₹111876.6 Cr, which is 14.65% increase over the budget  allocated in 2023-24 (₹97579.05 Cr) and 13.74% over the RE for 2023-24  (₹98359.41 Cr). Notably, no funds have been allocated for the defence  spectrum, for which DoT estimated a large amount of ₹2285.32 Cr last  year, but utilised only 13.8% of it (₹315.55 Cr).

https://preview.redd.it/76z7esge45ic1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1cffbfdc79ede2ca56252b6e10f40cabfe334de

&#x200B;

* **MIB:** The total budgetary allocation  for MIB in 2024-25 is ₹4342.55 Cr, which is a 7.45% decrease from the  2023-2024 Budget. This cut comes after MIB seemingly was able to utilise  a higher budget allocation last year, which seems incongruent. The  allocation for Central Sector Schemes/Projects under MIB has plateaued  as compared to the BE 2023-2024.

https://preview.redd.it/mrdj24eg45ic1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb3c4243f6dc84e35908a2ab87d56282146af183

&#x200B;

* **MHA:** The total budgetary allocation  for MHA is 2.84% lower than what was allocated in the BE for the FY  2023-24. The allocation in the budget estimates, net of receipts and  recoveries, for MHA is ₹5733.51 Cr. Although there is a 11.97% increase  over the 2023-24 RE that was pegged at ₹5120.78 Cr, the allocation is  still 13.22% lower than what was made in 2023-24. The allocation for  planned capital expenditure has marginally dipped as compared to both  the 2023-2024 BE ( by 1.27%) and RE (by 6.21%), which is disappointing.

## Questions, answers, and discussions

### Digi Yatra Implementation and data security

On  February 05, Niranjan Reddy asked the Ministry of Civil Aviation in the  Rajya Sabha for insights on passenger data collection via Digi Yatra,  measures taken to prevent unauthorised access/misuse, and whether  passengers have visibility and control over their data, incl right to  access, rectify & delete data, as well as the Ministry’s plans to  place Digi Yatra under govt oversight for enhanced security and  transparency. The Minister of State answered that the DigiYatra Central  Ecosystem prioritises privacy by design and default and all personal  passenger data is stored locally in the passenger’s smartphone wallet  itself. He added that data is shared with the origin airport for ID  validation and purged within 24 hrs post-flight departure, and that the  government ensures data security and process transparency in Digi Yatra  by maintaining passenger data locally only and purging it from the  central system. 

However, this does not solve a central issue with  DigiYatra, which lacks transparency in its data flow and sharing  practices, with vague privacy policy provisions and discrepancies in  officials' statements. Neither its nodal authority nor auditing body,  which is the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (“CERT-in”)  falls  under the RTI Act. Read IFF’s detailed analysis on Digi Yatra [here](https://internetfreedom.in/reject-digiyatra/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

### Regulation of deepfakes

On  February 05, Parliamentarian Harbhajan Singh asked MeitY if it is  cognizant of the risks associated with disruptive technologies such as  Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and deepfakes, and their plans to enact  regulations in these domains. Minister of State replied that the  government’s internet policies prioritise an open, safe and accountable  online space for all “Digital Nagriks”, and that they plan to leverage  the potential of AI for innovation across sectors while being mindful of  its risks, especially in the case of deepfakes. 

He stated that  as for regulation the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media  Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“IT Rules, 2021”) obligate intermediaries to  promptly address misinformation, which includes deepfakes. Under these  Rules certain Grievance Appellate Committees are set up to ensure a  user-friendly redressal, and the Ministry adopts a zero-tolerance stance  on deepfakes which mandates platforms to align their terms of use and  swiftly remove prohibited content. He added that recent advisories of  the Ministry emphasise compliance with IT Rules, 2021 for  intermediaries, while users are being informed about content guidelines  and potential legal consequences. The National Cyber Crime Reporting  Portal and helpline are also available for grievance redress. 

As  deepfakes took centre stage in 2023, MeitY decided to tackle the issue  head-on. However, what ensued was several conflicting statements from  MeitY and rushed interventions without deeply understanding or  consulting over the issues, which is not the best-suited response to  systemic issues like deepfakes. Read IFF’s analysis on this issue [here](https://internetfreedom.in/dealing-with-deepfakes/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).  Further, Grievance Appellate Committees are not the solution to the  problem – they worryingly make the government an arbiter of permissible  speech on the internet and incentivise social media platforms and  intermediaries to suppress any speech unpalatable to the government.  Read more of IFF’s work on GACs under the IT Rules, 2021 [here](https://internetfreedom.in/public-brief-on-the-it-amendment-rules-2022/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

### Internet and child mental health

On  February 02, in Lok Sabha, Parliamentarian Shashi Tharoor asked the  Ministry of Women and Child Development about their awareness of surveys  done on the mental health concerns prevalent among internet-using  children, and steps taken to address the issue, especially by the Kerala  government where the rates are worryingly high. Minister of State  answered that the government does not know of the survey, but studies  have been done by the National Commission For Protection of Child Rights  on the effects of mobile phone and internet usage on school children  which suggest similar trends. She added that the government addresses  mental health burden in children through the National Mental Health  Programme and Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram, focused on holistic  adolescent development with mental health as a key area. This is  supported by the Ayushman Bharat School Health and Wellness Programme  and a National Tele Mental Health Programme with 34 states/UTs already  offering tele-mental health services, handling over 6,28,000 calls.

### Rural connectivity and digital panchayats

On  February 06, in Lok Sabha,Parliament Damore Guman asked the Ministry of  Panchayati Raj about their plans for technological advancements in  Panchayati Raj Institutions (“PRI”), status of FTTH internet  connectivity in PRIs in Madhya Pradesh, how long until remaining Gram  Panchayats have internet access, and the Ministry’s efforts to raise  digital literacy among newly elected representatives. Minister of State  replied that eGramSwaraj app enhances transparency in Panchayat  governance, with 2.52L PRIs uploading development plans and 2.41L  completing online transactions for grants. AuditOnline ensures  accountable finances, with 2.49L audit plans created. He added that  BharatNet aims to connect all PRIs with broadband and 2,14,300 are  presently service-ready. A ‘Model Panchayat Citizens Charter’ ensures  timely services for citizens, and over 2.32L Gram Panchayats have  conducted Gram Sabha to facilitate this. On digital literacy efforts, he  stated that the revamped Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan empowers  Panchayats through technical training for Elected Representatives,  focusing on governance capabilities and SDG localisation at grassroots level. 

### Regulatory scope of DPDPA

On  February 07, in Lok Sabha, Parliamentarian Tenkasi asked MeitY about  the key objectives of Digital Personal Data Protection (“DPDP”) Act  2023, its impact on personal data processing in India, and its scope to  advance India's AI adoption while safeguarding personal data. Further,  he asked how the government is ensuring companies comply with redressal  mechanisms and penalties under the Act, what steps are being taken to  educate citizens about their statutory rights and what measures are in  place to ensure compliance by data fiduciaries. Minister of State  answered that the DPDP Act focuses solely on protection of personal data  & establishes rights and duties of Data Principals and obligations  of Data Fiduciaries – including safeguarding personal data against  breaches & fostering responsible data processing practices. He added  that the Act establishes a Data Protection Board to penalise  non-compliance, ensuring accountability and imposing fines on processors  violating data protection standards and that a transition period of  6-12 mos will be provided for them to adapt and comply to the new  regime. 

The DPDP Act in its current form is flawed on many  aspects – it makes personal data vulnerable to online scraping, has weak  notice requirements, gives sweeping exemptions to govt and private  actors in unclear circumstances, imposes penalties on data principals,  and so on. Further, the public consultation process for the current  version is flawed, as it was tabled and passed in the parliament without  specific consultations and though its previous version was open for  feedback from the public, the suggestions were not publicly displayed,  neither were they incorporated, at least not in a transparent manner.  IFF has done a deeper analysis on the Act, which can be [accessed here](https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-first-read-of-the-draft-digital-personal-data-protection-bill-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

### Voter card linking with Aadhaar

On  February 09, several Lok Sabha members asked the Ministry of Law and  Justice about the number of Voter IDs linked with Aadhaar since the  Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021 and how consent is being obtained  for the same. They also inquired about how a voter’s Aadhaar details  will be deleted upon withdrawal of consent and if the names of voters  not linked with Aadhaar will be removed from voter lists. Further, they  asked about the measures put in place to safeguard the voter database  from misuse. Minister of State replied saying that the Election  Commission of India (“ECI”) has previously clarified that the  Representation of the People Act, 1950, as amended by the Election Laws  Act, 2021, permits Electoral Registration Officers to request Aadhaar  numbers from electors voluntarily for identity verification. He added  that starting August 01, 2022, a voluntary Aadhaar collection program  has been initiated nationwide but linking of Aadhaar with Election Photo  Identity Cards has not commenced yet. For now, submitting Aadhaar with  Voter ID is optional, with consent obtained via Form 6B. Currently there  are no provisions for deleting Aadhaar details if consent is withdrawn.  The ECI oversees electoral roll preparation and ensures data security  through multi-layered encryption.

### One Nation, One Student ID

On  February 05, Parliamentarians asked the Education Ministry for clarity  on the “One Nation, One Student ID” initiative, including the objectives  of the initiative, measures to ensure student data confidentiality, and  guidelines to prevent data breaches. Minister of State for Education  replied that under the framework, a ‘registry framework’ tracks  students’ academic journeys, facilitates credit transfers, and aligns  programs with skill components. Stringent data security measures under  MeitY’s guidelines will ensure confidentiality and prevent data  breaches. IFF has previously flagged the framework for the privacy  concerns it raises, which persist despite the Minister’s assurances.  Read our analysis [here](https://internetfreedom.in/aadhaar-based-student-id-raises-alarms-for-privacy/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

There were other discussions that we tracked live, including on [data collection through Aarogya Setu](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1755944028858675574?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in), linking of [Aadhaar with health schemes](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1755942437556466046?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [leaks of Aadhaar data](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1755940560345411611?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) in recent times, blocking of content on social media sites ([here](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1755571146617975089?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in), here), [regulation of pirated content](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1754840962717671557?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in), status and mechanisms under the [Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1755569289547919802?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in), cybercrimes and fraud ([here](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1755486608965456282?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [here](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1755481557010157760?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in)), building capacity and [upskilling for Digital Public Infrastructure](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1754837957712728416?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) roll-out, and the impact of [AI on the labour market](https://x.com/IFFonParliament/status/1754829447620899055?s=20&ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

## Conclusion

The  Budget Session gave us one notable high, which is a marked increase in  Ministerial budgets, but other than that sustained trends from last year  – high projected estimates but underutilisation of funds. In light of  the increasing digitisation across sectors and the increasing demand for  improved digital literacy as well as access to digital services, we  hope that the fund allocation in these concerned sectors continue to  witness a positive trend. In terms of productivity, though both houses  sat for an extra day, the discussions focused on political agenda items  since this would be the last parliamentary sitting for the 17th Lok  Sabha, and the last for the incumbent government before we break for  elections in April-May 2024. Some pertinent questions were asked by  opposition members which touched upon digital rights and freedoms, but  we noted that the responses were not adequate, and data privacy concerns  for many issues remain unaddressed. We remain optimistic that the  upcoming union government will give these issues their deserved  attention and careful consideration.

1cfxaqb,India,election manifesto,"Biggest pity for me is how stray dog control isn't part of the election manifesto. If it were, I'd happily vote for a party which is proactive in dealing with it. ","
Why? Well we cant live in a city where a child walking in the street isn't safe. I would love to take care of street dogs if our governments had the money to do so.. in fact I'd rather our government spend less on maintaining city roads and instead use all that money to construct a massive dog farm to help street dogs. 

But in no possible way would I want stray dogs to be released in the streets and treated as ""street"" dogs. 

You either raise the funds to go all the way to treating them humanely by contructing dog parks or humanely euthanize them when their population is too big. But in no world can we permit an innocent 1 year old child being mauled to death and yet having no measure of recourse to prevent these from happening again. 

I like what bjp has done for infrastructure but I'd happily switch to any party whatsoever who can take a more practical, immediate and proactive stand to take care of stray dogs. 

Again, I am not saying cruelly culling them as the only solution. 

But releasing dogs to the streets is definitely not a solution. You either tax, reprioritize infra funds and create massive dog parks to maintain them or humanely euthanize them if their population becomes too high.

1c59v6o,India,election manifesto,"Collating Indian Political Parties' Election Manifestos Supporting Queer (LGBTQ+) Rights
","I'm putting together a resource that collates and analyzes the election manifestos of Indian political parties that support queer rights. The aim is to identify and discuss how different parties within our nation are planning to address LGBTQ+ issues through their policy commitments.

If you have access to or knowledge about the election manifestos from any Indian political party that explicitly supports or promotes queer rights, could you please help by sharing:

1. The name of the political party.
2. Specific points or excerpts from their manifesto that relate to LGBTQ+ rights.
3. Links to the official manifestos or reliable sources where these documents can be accessed.
4. Any additional observations or insights about the party's stance and actions regarding queer rights.

This information will be incredibly helpful for voters who are keen on supporting parties that prioritize queer rights and for those who wish to be more informed about the political landscape concerning LGBTQ+ issues in India.

Thank you so much for your help and engagement!",0,0.38,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1c59v6o/collating_indian_political_parties_election/,Matt_Samuel,2024-04-16 07:10:24

1c2wkka,India,election manifesto,Why you must read the Congress Manifesto.,"Apart from the Paanch Nyay which outlines the promises of the manifesto and embodies the spirit of its electoral plank, Congress' manifesto makes bold and crucial promises which makes it one of the most progressive document in the nation's history.

After years of corporate and communal agenda of the Modi Government, Congress' pro-people plank is a breath of fresh air for a nation reeling under crises of unemployment, inequality, and injustice. Congress' manifesto also sets a progressive agenda for the election, and stands in contrast to the Muslim League and Veg/Non-Veg agenda of Modi.

The manifesto is divided into 10 sections on Equity, Youth, Women, Workers, Farmers, Defending the Constitution, Economy, Federalism, National Security, and Environment.

Some key points from the manifesto:

1. Reform in collegium system, establishing a court of appeals, promoting diversity in judiciary.

2. Recognising civil unions for same-sex marriage.

3. Protection of civil liberties and freedom of dress, food, and language.

4. Reform in personal laws.

5. Gender equality, equal work, equal pay, hostel for working women.

6. Decriminalising civil defamation.

7. Right to Privacy.

8. Strengthening Parliamentary System.

9. End to weaponization of law, police raj, custodial deaths.

10. Right to health.

11. Addressing the growing inequality.

12. Multi-modal urban public transport. 

13. Environment Protection and Climate Change Authority, Green New Deal Investment Programme

14. Apprenticeship scheme modelled on Germany's Dual Education System to promote skill and employment, reform in gig economy, district level start-up fund.

16. Urban employment guarantee act, right to health and social security for the workers, end to the casualization of labour.

1crmgct,India,election manifesto,What’s it gonna take for us as a society to finally care about air quality and climate change on a mass scale? ,"As an indian residing overseas, I visit india about twice a year and every time after I land, I get either a nasal infection, itchiness or face allergies which are not gone until I go back to my country of residence. Doctors often point out that it is the reaction to the extreme air pollution. I know many people who face similar issues. Living in an indian metropolis is equivalent to smoking multiple cigarettes daily. 

— I’m deeply concerned about the lack of widespread action and the unmuted response to the environmental emergencies. 

- We owe it to our parents who deserve to breathe fresh air in their golden years, to fellow citizens l, and future generations. They should inherit the nation that’s as beautiful and bountiful as its meant to be. 

- It goes beyond health. Imagine getting unobscured view of the Himalayas and our country being lauded for the beauty and cleanliness and us becoming a leader in promoting a cleaner and pristine natural environment, globally.

- In my country of residence , Germany, parties are solely formed on the basis of environmental issues. ( Green party for example) and elections can make or break on the basis of environmental issues.

- This also has to do with what we as a society demand from our law and policy makers. Here I observe a huge pressure from the general population to breathe fresh air, get clean water and access to a ton of natural beauty to make living more fulfilling. 

- We are still way focussed on topics such as communal and religious politics, in an unhealthy proposition. 

- I am sure many people who have been in other parts of the world also more or less notice it. But it still hasn’t become a mainstream issue. None of the election  manifestos emphasise on those topics. I wonder what is it going to take to finally that to happen! 




Edit: A lot of people are straight up jumping to developed cvs developing country comparison. My question is, is physics and ecology going to care and wait until your, mine and our loved ones’ bodies have permanent damages? Are the ice glaciers going to wait for the next 50 years until India is developed and the wrongdoing in the past by other countries are balanced before cities like Mumbai are submerged? And other extreme weather conditions? Also why cannot we make our living conditions better if we see an obvious problem instead of jumping into ‘what-aboutism’ ?

1c63beh,India,election manifesto,Whose Manifesto do you like better? I have created a word doc that has topic wise side by side comparison. All the points are as they appear in the manifestos. (I haven't changed anything),"**Here is the document :** [**Manifesto Topic Wise Comparison**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yzUa5PXtgJg_mXJxsLH4zFIcA6Ohy5ho/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112103166487411801226&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**About the document**

*Read Time of the entire document : 15 Minutes*

*The document has exact words from both the manifestos without change, and I have included all the points in both the manifestos and classified it topic wise MANUALLY. No ChatGPT or any other AI tools used so that they don't miss any points and hallucinate etc etc.*

*Some points can belong to multiple topics, I have added most points only once in the Document.*

*If you think some points can be better classified into other sections, Please suggest/comment in the document or here.*

*It would be great if any of you can convert this into an interactive website (like streamlit using python) for greater accessibility and good.*

*Please form your opinions only after going through the entire document/manifestos, There are a lot of things proposed by both sides that are astonishing and are less talked about in the social media/media space*

**General first thoughts about both the manifestos:**

1. The first thing that caught my attention was that, Congress' manifesto has neutral English language and neutral section pictures. BJPs manifesto is so much filled with hindi words in English that is so hard to comprehend and you know has name and pictures of Modi everywhere.
2. Congress' Manifesto is overall well balanced and less vague than BJP and gives my heart a positive hope about our shared future. Finally it feels like all the things we rant about on reddit regarding democracy and centralization of power has been addressed. However their manifesto on travel infrastructure (like ports/airports/roads) is short and general. BJPs Manifesto is filled majorly only related to infrastructure points that are vague.. In most points they talk about what they have done in the past and how they will continue the same. 
3. Congress emphasises a lot on the personal human aspect of governance like freedoms and liberties.

**Freebies or Welfare** whatever you call it **:** 

1. **The Myth that congress is a freebie government and something that would bankrupt us is overblown**. 
2. **What if I told you BJP also doles out equal freebies if not more?**   
I was shocked to know that BJP in last 10 years has given out 34 LAKH CRORE ALONE in direct cash transfers to beneficiaries. They have mentioned this in the initial pages if you want to verify.
3. What CONGRESS is probably going to do is unbundle various schemes through which the present govt does cash transfers and then re-bundle them into one scheme ""MahaLakshmi"" and give out 1 Lakh per poor women family.
4. Congress is most likely to do this transfers only after socio-economic survey and my guess is that it would atleast take a year or two along with census. They would try to limit the outflow as much as possible. 
5. Lastly since the amount is fixed at 1L a year , as economy grows this outflow will remain same while collections increase.

**Democracy, Constitutional Bodies and Judiciary:** 

1. **This section is what gives me a positive hope.**
2.  **Division of Supreme Court into 1. Constitutional Court 2. Court of Appeal** 
   1. I think this is to avoid judges to sit on cases of constitutional validity/importance for years like the electoral bonds case since 2019 and the money bill to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny
3. Congress in depth talks about decentralization of power after their experience of having brutally suffered in the last 10 years and the abuse of power. They now know what to fix to strengthen this democracy.
   1. **From Centre to States** : 
      1. They said they would transfer some subjects from concurrent list to state list. Basically making the centre focus more on things like defense (national security), foreign affairs and give more autonomy to states and better tax sharing between centre/states
   2. **Remember Delhi Govt and constant interference from LG (Lt. Governor)?** : Here is what they say
      1.  We will amend the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 and declare that the Lieutenant Governor shall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of NCT, Delhi on all matters, including Services, except on matters concerning the three reserved subjects. 
   3.  **More Powers to Local City and Rural Bodies (:** 
      1. Taking into account rapid urbanisation, they say that they will amend the laws to grant more executive, financial and administrative powers to the directly-elected Mayor/Chairperson for effective governance in urban local bodies and gram sabhas/panchayats *( a. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996. (b.) The Forest Rights Act, 2006. (c.) The Land Acquisition Act, 2013).* I think this has to do something with taking over of villagers/tribal land for commercial exploitation and deforestation..
      2. Improved Governance of Mayors To improve urban governance, the Mayor/Chairperson will be directly elected for a fixed term of 5 years along with a Council. Executive, financial and administrative powers will be conferred upon the Mayor/Chairperson. The administration will be accountable to the Mayor/Chairperson and the Council. 
      3. I think this has something to do with local cities not holding mayoral elections regularly like BMC/BBMP
      4. A portion of GST revenues will be allocated to panchayats and municipalities 
   4. **More Powers to Sport Bodies :** They also talk about decentralization of power to sport bodies acc to recommendations of the Justice Lodha Committee and Olympic Charter etc to prevent and solve the whole mess around wrestlers.
   5.  **Institutionalize the process of appointing the Chief of Defence Staff  to ensure transparency and military consensus**
   6. **Prevention of Horse Trading , automatic disqualification:**  to amend the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution and make defection  an auto disqualification of the membership in the Assembly or Parliament.
   7. **Law to tally 100% of EVM with VVPAT**
   8. **We promise to strengthen the autonomy of the Election Commission of India (VAGUE)**
   9. **NO To One Nation One Election (A BIG BIG THING FOR DEMOCRACY)** 
   10. **To Improve Transparency in Media and Give more freedoms to Journalists**
      1. **Repeal Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023**
      2. Review and delete controversial clauses that give  unbridled powers of censorship to the government from Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023; Press and Registration of Periodicals Act, 2023, etc.)
      3.  Amend the Press Council of India Act, 1978 to strengthen the system of self regulation, protect journalistic freedoms, uphold editorial independence and guard against government interference against arbitrary search and seizures...
   11. **Pledge to ensure that both Houses of Parliament will convene for 100 days each year, reviving and upholding the esteemed traditions of Parliament.** 
   12. **Additionally, one day per week will be dedicated to discussing the agenda proposed by opposition benches in each House.** 
   13. **We promise to end the arbitrary and indiscriminate suspension of the Internet**
   14. **Review the Telecommunications Act, 2023 and remove the provisions that restrict freedom of speech and expression and that violate the right to privacy.** We promise to review all laws that interfere with the right to privacy and make suitable amendments to various laws to uphold the right to privacy
   15.We promise to enact a law on bail that will incorporate the principle that ‘bail is the rule, jail is the exception’ in all criminal laws.
   16. **Review of all Laws passed without discussion and scrutiny by NDA**
      1. all anti-people laws passed by the BJP/NDA without proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate, especially those relating to workers, farmers, criminal justice, environment & forests and digital data protection, will be thoroughly reviewed and changed. 

Rest of the things I will talk in future posts..

1cb6n9s,India,election manifesto,Unpopular Opinion : The fault is ours. Not BJPs or Opposition or Media or anyone else. Only we are to be blamed.,"
**Reddit/Twitter** is full of complaints:
Each and every day.

1. **Shitting** on the **BJP**.
2. **Criticizing** the **opposition** for perceived incompetence and failing to stop the **BJP** or their freebies/welfare whatever you call it
3. **Blaming** the **Godi media** for being biased and adding to the propaganda
4. **Losing hope** on **Judiciary** since it is **50/50 compromised**.

I am not going into pros and cons of any party. We have heard all the arguments of all the parties. Enough is enough.

But these posts overlook the most important aspect: the role we, the citizens, play in a democracy.

Not a single post talks about responsibility of citizens in a democracy.

**A DEMOCRACY/NATION IS ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS CITIZENS ARE.**

We, on the other hand, merely **rant online** while our democracy crumbles before our own eyes **AND EACH PARTY , takes us for a ride. Without exception.**

It’s useless to blame others and expect improvement.

Sometimes I think most of the poor or the rural people actually vote based on inflation/jobs/livelihoods and it is the urban middle class (swing votes/centrist) who has basic things sorted who falls for all these religious propaganda and so on.

**And ofcourse most of us redditors are privileged and these things don’t directly affect us, so we turn a blind eye, but sooner than later they will get to us. Pollution, Climate, Pathetic Rule of Law, Freedoms , etc**

**No PARTY cares for the middle class.**

The rich get richer in any govt and the poor get benefits (no, im in no way against welfarism) in any govt and the middle class is milked maximum.

Yet despite all of the above we dont take any concrete action or measures.

**Now let me mention some of the probable usual responses to this post :**

>1)Im trying to Get out of this country as soon as possible, you too do the same.
There’s no point of living in this country.

>*Happy and Good for you bro/sis. Nothing against you. Its just our collective fault that we have failed as a nation and causing people to move out abroad for better life*

>2) Don’t take so much stress bro

>3) Nothing can be done to this country, it’s beyond repair 

>4) We are f%*$*# 

>5) Ayega toh modi hii 

>6) There is no alternative (TINA) illusionary effect 

>7)” Sorry to say or add the word honesty and say we can’t do anything” 

>8) It’s not worth it, leave it 

>9) Elect a clown, Expect a circus. 

>10) The masses deserve this 
Etc etc…..

As Andy Dufresne said in Shawshank Redemption, 
>""***Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies***.""

Let's hold onto hope and try to work together to chart a better future.

MENTION ONLY AND ONLY ACTIONABLE STEPS we can do. Nothing else. So what can we do in the run upto to the elections to ensure that our country,freedom and constitutional democracy are protected and in the long run too? 

Apart from educating people, because this we have to do anyways.

Please dont comment anything that is not actionable or any of the usual rhetoric responses that I mentioned above. Done with all these usual rhetoric. 🙏🙏🙏NO BJP CONGRESS AAP, no political party. Just take about citizens.

Only solutions and actions. If we collectively spend even 5% of the time we spend just criticising everyone and complaining, all of us can change something if not nothing and that in itself is a success, however small

1bzosfy,India,election manifesto,Reasons not to vote for congress (as per their manifesto ),"1. The Congress guarantees that it will pass a constitutional amendment to raise the 50 per cent cap on reservations for SC, ST and OBC (pg - 6) \[they have completely ignored merit\]
2. Congress will abolish the contractualization of regular jobs in the government and public sector enterprises and ensure regularisation of such appointments (pg - 6) \[this contractualization of govt jobs for eg lets say teaching aim at improving the teaching quality but then again INC wants to abolish this and go back to teachers who would even get away with not attending the college\]
3. We will enact a law with reference to Article 15(5) of the Constitution to provide for reservation in private educational institutions for SC, ST and OBC (pg -6) \[Private colleges tend to have high fees, on whom would the burden lie? the govt?\]
4. We promise that healthcare will be universal and free in public health centres such as hospitals, clinics, primary health centres, mobile healthcare units, dispensaries and health camps. Free healthcare will include examination, diagnostics, treatment, surgery, medicines, rehabilitation and palliative care (pg-9) \[this cannot be possible in a country like India, all of that burden would be placed on the middle class\]
5. Government will give a one-time relief to applicants who were unable to write the qualifying public examinations during 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2021 due to the pandemic (pg-11) \[freebies\]
6. We will ensure that all higher educational institutions — central, state and private — meet the prescribed standards for admitting students. We will revisit the policy of centrally-conducted qualifying examinations such as NEET, CUET, etc. and make it optional for state governments to adopt these examinations for admissions or conduct their own examinations meeting the prescribed standards to state-funded and state-approved higher educational institutions (pg-13) \[This would again reduce chances for talented individuals to be admitted in top colleges, for eg its very hard for students in Bihar board to score 99% as compared to students of Kerala board\]
7. We will reserve one-half (50 per cent) of central government jobs for women starting in 2025 (pg-16)
8. We reject the ‘one nation one election’ idea and we promise that elections to the Lok Sabha and the State Assemblies will be held as and when they are due in accordance with the Constitution and the traditions of a parliamentary democracy (pg - 22) \[one nation one election would save lots of cost for govt\]
9. We promise to enact a law on bail that will incorporate the principle that ‘bail is the rule, jail is the exception’ in all criminal laws. (pg-22)

didnt put in effort to read pg 28 onwards, these were enough reasons for me not to vote for congress. only thing i found commendable was their protest against the telecommunication bill.

1cbuxc6,India,election manifesto,Political Strategy of BJP and why they are going off-limits,"During Karnataka elections there was a huge anti-incumbency factor. The congress did a great job by raising questions like poverty, employement and kept it grounded. Whereas BJP's main focus was Hindutva. In addition to this, the Congress party highlighted their shortcomings. Even after the backing of Media among other things, Congress was able to win. 

What BJP is trying to do now is to go off-limits. BJP's strategy is to

1) Defame the Congress manifesto
2) Invoke Hindu-Muslim
3) Paint Congress as anti-hindu

Is it going to work?

1) The Hindu-Muslim narrative will backfire a little since most people saw Modi as good guy. Now his mask is off. There are things to say. People who don't care much about Hindu-Muslim is not gonna vote for him now. A percentage of Swing voters mainly. 
As for people who care about Hindu-Muslim, they were already in Team BJP. 


2) Defame the Congress - that's where BJP is hitting their mark

Rural people are the main victims. 
They are trying their best to defame Congress and their manifesto through the mangalsutra narrative and wealth redistribution narrative. 

Nowhere in their manifesto ""wealth redistribution"" is even mentioned. Lmao 😂. In fact, in the interview with Rahul, wealth redistribution word was never mentioned by him. They did mention reducing income disparity etc. 

3) Paint Congress as anti-hindu -
Softcore Hindutva people are going to be influenced by these narrative 

If the Congress is able to clear its image and the image of the manifesto, they will be able to have good chances. People are angry with BJP.

1) Kshatriyas, Jatts, Muslims are not going to vote for BJP amid tensions
2) Farmers are very unlikely to vote for BJP
3) They've already decreased their focus to only hsrd-followes of Hindus
4) Anti-incumbency is a big factor. Nobody except Nehru has been able to come to power for 15 years.
5) Exam leaks, Unemployment. A big percentage of people are angry with BJP
6) They've given much evidence that India is headed towards dictatorship

After the first phase, Modi's strategy has changed. He has become a little desperate and BJP as a whole became very hostile. 

If Congress can make it through there's a high chance they might win.",40,0.7,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1cbuxc6/political_strategy_of_bjp_and_why_they_are_going/,Kitchen-Inflation-73,2024-04-24 10:39:01
1c4ezb6,India,election manifesto,"Heathcare system in India ... does it even work in Tier 2/3 cities, towns and villages ?","Healthcare system sucks in India. If you live anywhere other than Tier 1 cities in India, then God may be help you better as qualified and urgent care in almost non-existent in majority of India.

Its not money. Even if people have money, many people lose their lives in India due to not getting timely intervention and qualified doctor support.  Fake/Quack doctors or MBBS doctors faking as specialists running their own clinic and misguiding patients is a norm than exception

The worst I have noticed in Tier 3/4 cities and towns is Pharmacists/Chemists doubling up as doctors in their stores and treating patients including giving them vaccines and IV drugs and prescribing medicines when they are not even allowed to. clinics running with doctors remotely. In one such incident, the compounder (doctor's helper) treated the patient and prescribed medicine sitting on doctor's chair While Doctor was guiding him on the phone remotely from another city.   People believed that helper to be the doctor

It's such a sad state of healthcare in India and none of the politicians have healthcare on their election manifesto. whether its Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi, none of them talk about improving healthcare system and provide accountability. When politicians from both BJP or Congress talk about economy, development and growth, healthcare seems to be missing in all these aspects.   in the 2023 budget, 175 nursing colleges were budgeted for, but no budget gets allocated for accountability on quality.

investing in Digital infra or Healthstack by Product Nation/ISPIRT is important only if the system can provide actual healthcare and save lives. otherwise digital infra is a waste and is just a gimmick to make rich people richer by just building tech and making money.

how do you even think that healthcare system can improve to benefit people?

1dtf7mw,India,development politics India,Will India ever look like a developed country even if she becomes one?,"My point is Indian economy today by numbers is equivalent to china's economy in 2008 around $3.7 Trillion. But I don't think any big cities in India like Delhi or Mumbai look like Beijing or Shanghai from 2008. Beijing was able to host Olympics at that time which is biggest sports event. And definitely had better infrastructure and looked like a global city even back then. So if we look into future India will inevitably become $10 Trillion economy around 2035 which China became in 2014. But no one believes that any Indian city will look like a Chinese city in 2014. That's very big problem for India as people over world will hear this in news and media and think well maybe India is in better position now but then when they will visit and see it still looks like it did in 2015. And this might go on forever like even in 2050 Indian economy will be bigger than current Chinese economy but will any Indian city look like a global city by then? I am comparing with china as it has almost same demography. But even if you compare it to other eastern European countries like Portugal ,Poland or Belarus which are not as rich as western Europe India lacks very badly.  This will put India in a very strange position as it almost will be the only country in the world in that kind of weird position where economically it would have advanced but visually it will still be underdeveloped. So will India ever look like a developed country in reality even if by numbers she becomes one? And if not then why not where is the problem? I think there is something very fundamentally wrong with how Indian cities are built which will be the reason for it.

1b73vkm,India,development politics India,India becoming a developed nation,"Economy is not everything. We need fundamental changes in way our society operates. We have normalised some of the most inhumane practices and with the prevalent chalta hai attitude surrendered our fundamental rights. Going forward with the economic stratification becoming even more acute, there will be (already is?) a section of society for whom India will be like a developed nation. For others it will always be a developing nation. 

So what are some characteristics of developed nation which we should aspire to have? I will list a few that I think are fundamental to the idea 

* Free/cheap and good healthcare, should not be limited to upper class
* Drinking water: taps should have directly potable water, this unfortunately is not true almost anywhere. For all your needs otherwise there is a tanker service. Imagine dreaming of India becoming a developed nation while we don't have potable water coming from the taps.
* Public transport with good facilities 
* Free/cheap good education
* Transparency in government dealings 
* Following Traffic rules
* Freedom of speech
* Free press
* Basic respect other (gender, religion, social class, state)

This is more sounding like a wishlist for a utopia but think about it. These are some of the essential givens for a developed nation. But we think of them as luxuries!
And of course there is corruption at each level. 

Not sure if we will see any of these being implemented happening in my lifetime but one can hope. And hope is that thing which keeps one going.

1b640ga,India,development politics India,Incident on Indigo airlines yesterday just confirms how unsafe India is for women,"Yesterday I was travelling from one small town to a metro on Indigo airlines. I was a solo traveller and just behind were a group of 12-15 youngsters. Seems like they are all working in the same company and they came here for a colleague's wedding. The group had 3 ladies. 

As they were boarding the flight, some of them were commenting on the air hostess. Once they sat, one guy said he could get the airhostess to buckle his friend up. Then he accepted the challenge and calls the air hostess and tells her "" the buckle isnt working properly. Can you help?"". She politely buckles his seat which had no issues. When she goes away they cheer for him and that shockingly included the ladies who were travelling in that group. They were calling some of them ""Sir"", which means some senior in the company. Not a single person in the group objected and even the women found it funny to degrade the air hostess. 

Of the back of what happened in Jharkhand, this is South India and the group wasnt some uneducated drug taking jobless guys. It was a mixed group but still they didnt think it was wrong to do so. After that happened, I felt ashamed that I didnt standup and tell the guys off. Me being a silent onlooker isnt blameless. I wish I had some sense and guts to standup and stop it. 

Edit - I didn't mean in certain state is uneducated or on drugs. I heard many people say the reason for crime is joblessness, drugs and porn addiction. Reading back I realise I should have written it better. Not meant to offend anyone from any part of India. This behaviour is prevalent across India.

19dvi15,India,development politics India,Tell me there’s hope for India,"I left India in 2019 after growing up in Calcutta, studying in Delhi, and working between Bangalore and Hyderabad.

The events from the last few days have left me questioning- is there hope?

Ever since BJP came into power, I have seen people change. People I went to school and uni with. People with the same value systems.

As much as I never differentiated or discriminated between my friends, they told me to keep my opinions to myself because I’ve left the country. I should just focus on making dollars while they supported the Citizenship Amendment Bill, nationalisation, saffronisation, and what not.

Raised in a religious family, I became agnostic because I saw so much hatred for other religions. My childhood friends are from these other religions.

I don’t know if there was a mosque first or a temple but I want secularism to prevail in our country. We pride on it, don’t we? I love how all religions and cultures come together in India. I love how my friends invite me over whenever I’m back home.

I just want the nation not to be divided based on religion.

Tell me there’s hope.

EDIT: 

3 hours and 140 comments later (some targeted, and some very insightful), I feel I don't need to explain my interest in my country even if I don't live there. I have family and friends there and I give a fuck, so don't give me the bullshit that ""since you've left, don't bother"". 

A country as big and populous as India invites debate and differing opinions. Freedom to think critically, invite discourse. I never said India was less divided or less/more radicalized before 2014. What I truly hope for India is less mingling of politics and religion. 

And lastly, I will not stop being interested in India no matter where I live or what colour d*ck I suck. Thanks.",1224,0.69,762,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/19dvi15/tell_me_theres_hope_for_india/,TieCandid9728,2024-01-23 18:41:28

1976t24,India,development politics India,"Why do Indians not possess basic civic sense, specially when it comes to our own country","I love India, it is always going to be home. I love how people are more or less always willing to help you when you are in a sticky situation, I know this is not everyone's experience but, so far I feel India is it's people. I love our incredibly rich and Ancient history, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, home to the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, home to mighty warriors and empires, home to great heroes and yet preaching humility in it's ethos, it's incredible, I can go on and on. But, in this post I want to talk about us Indians and what is going so wrong with us. I don't want to delve into politics, religion or caste, it's overdone and it always makes the conversation negative, maybe one day we evolve to have an open discussion about that too but, today I want to talk about other things. 

Cleanliness - We don't need to be educated to understand that literring is bad. I mean why do we just love throwing garbage everywhere, I have seen plastic garbage on the beaches of goa, mangroves of Kerala and even the mountain treks of Himachal. It's so pathetic, this has to purely be on us Indians right, it's so logical, hold on to your garbage till you find a bin.

Female safety - We have a pathetic rep for this, pathetic doesn't even describe a fraction of it. You can reach specific subs on reddit where women are narrating their most horrible experiences. My question is can we genuinely not do anything? I mean it's so bad, a country where the majority prays to goddesses and then the most heinous of crimes happen. Again I don't think this is government's fault or comes with uneducation

Not following rules - Yes it's tardy, we are a populous country so there are queues everywhere but, they are there for a reason. What is this flex of not wearing helmets, not stopping at red lights, breaking queues, actively offering bribes for smallest inconveniences and on and on

Ultra defensive - Recently some African accounts on Twitter posted about how Indian street food is very unhygienic and they did this through a very popular form of communication, posting funny memes. Well it is a fact, our street food vendors, specially some content available online shows very nicely how they dip their hands, sweat and sometimes entire bodies in the food they make. Many nationalists jumped on this and started racially abusing Africans. Why does it have to be like that, man our street food is unhygienic, period. Why so defensive that we call everything either Chinese or Pakistani propaganda

Pakistan - Man it's a failed state, move on. I hate that we even talk about that crap country and compare with ours, standards bro

Rich privilege - This is true in every part of the world. You are rich, you throw money at your problems and the problem vanishes. Only the problem here is the poverty is such high contrast that it makes the privilege look even more arrogant. It's just sad that income inequality is so exacerbated and most of the rich here are actually taking a crap on the poor

Infrastructure - It just sucks that our city infrastructure is not comparable to some of the best in the world. Even poorer cities have better public infrastructure than India's Mumbai and Delhi and it's not good. Now this point can be borderline politics, so I'll stop here

Healthcare - Though we have some of the cheapest Healthcare available, oh man the condition of hospitals is so bad it will make your eyes tear up, just go to a government hospital once and you will never ever wish anyone you know to get admitted in government hospitals.

One sport country - Cricket is great! If the Brits didn't invent it, I am sure some kids in Shivaji Park in Bombay would have. The only things we love more than cricket are our parents, emotional baggage, defensive mechanisms and insecurities. But hell a 10 country world cup with only 8 test playing nations is just laughable. There are so many atheletes out there who would die for our love and support and are waiting for just one chance to make us proud. We pin our hopes on them at a global event like the Olympics and then forget about them for 4 years. Specifically guys who support football clubs based in Europe but, won't go to see Indian football team play, screw all of you, you deserve a special place in the nethers of hell

I can go on but, I'll stop now. Maybe you guys can add more or counteract.

In the press conference, Atishi claims that BJP was peeved after Kejriwal's release and they hatched a plan with Maliwal at the centre to malign Kejriwal. Atishi claims that Maliwal came at the CM's residence in the morning and demanded to meet the CM. When her request was denied, she created a scene and threatened the CM's staff. 

This is the video that Atishi is basing her claims on: https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/exclusive-video-shows-swati-maliwal-at-arvind-kejriwals-home-after-alleged-assault-2540310-2024-05-17

Atishi claims that this video proves that Maliwal was not injured, and the claims that she has made in her FIR ([Maliwal slapped 7-8 times, kicked in chest, stomach, pelvis: FIR](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maliwal-slapped-7-8-times-kicked-in-chest-stomach-pelvis-fir-101715932510129.html)) are fake. 

AAP has also decided to use that video to dismiss Swati's claim: https://x.com/AamAadmiParty/status/1791411684851986768


Here are AAP's claims (translated) from their Twitter TL

>Ever since @ArvindKejriwal ji has come out of jail, BJP has been furious. In this sequence, BJP hatched a conspiracy and Swati Maliwal ji was made the face of it.

>Swati Maliwal ji reached CM residence without any appointment and she wanted to accuse the Chief Minister, but the CM was not there at that time and he was saved. After this, allegations were made against Vibhav Kumar ji.

>A video that surfaced today has exposed the truth of Swati Maliwal's allegations.

https://x.com/AamAadmiParty/status/1791456934039560252

>In the FIR to Delhi Police, Swati ji has claimed that she was brutally beaten up. Her head was injured and her clothes were torn. She has said all these things in her complaint.

>But in the video that has come today, nothing like this is visible. The video is showing the truth to the contrary. She is sitting comfortably on the sofa. She is threatening the policemen and Vibhav Kumar ji in a loud voice. She is using abusive language.

>The video today has made it clear that all the allegations made by Swati Maliwal ji are false and baseless.

https://x.com/AamAadmiParty/status/1791458518630834531

>Vibhav Kumar Ji has filed a complaint against Swati Maliwal Ji with Delhi Police and he has narrated the entire incident that happened on 13th May.

>On May 13, Swati ji reached the CM residence without any appointment. When she was stopped at the gate, she threatened the security personnel and went inside.

>After this, she forcefully went and sat in CM's residence and started insisting on meeting the CM there.

>After this, Vibhav Kumar ji came there and told her that the CM will not be able to meet her today. After this, she started talking to Vibhav Kumar ji in a loud voice and started pushing him and forcibly going inside. After this, security personnel were called and asked to take her out.

https://x.com/AamAadmiParty/status/1791463842414723532

>This entire incident proves that this was a conspiracy hatched by the BJP and Swati Maliwal was made its face. The aim of this conspiracy was to trap Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

>Swati Maliwal ji went to the police after this incident, where she was asked to undergo medical examination but she refused.

>Three days after this, BJP again brought Swati Maliwal ji forward with a new lie. But today's video has made everything clear.

https://x.com/AamAadmiParty/status/1791464600006717535

>When @SanjayAzadSln ji saw the news on media that Swati Maliwal had gone to the Police Station, then he met Swati Maliwal, till then he only had Swati's side in front of him.

>Now they also have Vibhav ji's side of the story and the video that has come out today proves that all the things said in the FIR are lies.

Response from Swati Maliwal

>Like every time, this time also this political hitman has started efforts to save himself.

>By getting his people to tweet and playing videos without any context, he thinks he can save himself by committing this crime. Who makes a video of someone being beaten up? The truth will be revealed to everyone as soon as the CCTV footage of the house and the room is checked.

>Fall to whatever level you can, God is watching everything. One day everyone's truth will come out in front of the world.

https://x.com/SwatiJaiHind/status/1791384728849072243

>The leaders who joined the party yesterday declared a 20-year old worker as a BJP agent. Two days ago the party had accepted the truth in the PC and today it has taken a U-turn

>This goon is threatening the party, if I get arrested I will reveal all the secrets. That is why he is roaming around in Lucknow and everywhere seeking shelter.

>Today, under his pressure, the party gave in and to save a goon, my character was questioned by the entire party. No problem, I have been fighting alone for the women of the entire country, I will fight for myself too. Do character assassination as much as possible, the truth will come out when the time comes!

Time will tell who is telling the truth. However, with these allegations it is obvious that Swati Mailwal's time in AAP has come to an end. A dramatic departure given that AAP had nominated her as a Rajya Sabha MP. 

Seen together with Raghav Chaddha's continued absence from campaigning (supposedly for an eye surgery), it seems that AAP will also see high profile departures like Congress has seen.",331,0.87,131,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1cu5ti3/aap_claims_that_swati_maliwal_hatched_a/,rahulthewall,2024-05-17 13:55:32

1bbgstm,India,booth capturing,If you have a little political influence and a blind crowd supporting you then you can do anything to anyone,"This is related to the recent Elvish vs Maxtern fiasco.    
    
    
    
Basically this Elvish and Maxtern dude had an online argument they both decided to meet and Elvish along with 8-10 guys went there to beat Maxtern. Due to his rowdy nature Maxtern decided to install a camera to record if something bad happens and guess what it happened, Elvish instantly started to beat Maxtern while he was trying to handshake. Elvish threatened to kill him and go to police if he can and nothing will happen. He did all this and put online status about it to mock Maxtern and show his power and influence.
    
    

Now the main thing starts now Maxtern decided to file a police complaint and guess what police denied to file the complaint on non bailable charges that Maxtern was demanding and the medical team refused to do his full medical checkup and gave an okay report. Meanwhile he uploaded the story on social media and instantly he was attacked by blind fans of Elvish, all of them tried to frame as if it was a prank and tried to demean Maxtern's credibility but later when the video of Elvish beating him was uploaded all blind fans still supported Elvish saying Maxtern deserved it because he messed with Elvish. Meanwhile Elvish said Maxtern abused his mother that's why he did it and revealed another person's address who was supporting Maxtern and berating Elvish constantly later he asked all his caste members to support him basically he played the tryiad of victim card, religion card and caste card. Police was still not arresting Elvish but when people started supporting Maxtern in huge number a guy named Rajat Dalal(this guy beat a guy with 20 men and escaped because his family members are judges) who was initially supporting Elvish went to Maxtern's house in night and kind of held him hostage in his own house. He said in a live stream that he will solve Maxtern and Elvish matter. Mastern meekly agreed on his words. Just imagine a unknown goon in your house suddenly making you hostage in your own house and making you say things you don't wanna because your family safety is at risk.    
    
    

He created an environment as if he was supporting Maxtern and will resolve the matter between them. Later Maxtern, Rajat and Elvish met below Maxtern flat's compound. Elvish arrived with 100+ men chanting his name like a 3rd class booth capturing politician of 1970s. All the men surrounded Maxtern and Elvish then they live streamed that there was a 'miscommunication' and all matters are resolved (who wouldn't say so when you're surrounded by 100).    
Now Maxtern will never get the justice he deserved, Elvish will never get the punishment he deserved and now his prospects as a future politician is bright as he got all perfect mix of both a mindless crowd who will chant your name and rowdyness to bully or suppress people lower than you.    
    
    
    

Now the question remains. Why are common Indian citizens so powerless? They can never protect their loved ones from local goon or a local Yuva neta. They have to accept any torment or humiliation so they don't offend these goons. They are helpless as the police and judiciary doesn't work as intended and they have to fight alone.    
    
Honestly it's so frustrating how the common class is treated just for votes and forgotten till eternity. ",210,0.95,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1bbgstm/if_you_have_a_little_political_influence_and_a/,asinnuj,2024-03-10 18:11:05

Pinarayi himself told the media that the Prime Minister asked him to consider the Prime Minister’s home as his own. Later, Modi came down to Pathanamthitta for the last assembly election and alleged that he knew where the gold smuggling took place. He repeated this allegation in the recent Lok Sabha election, saying that everyone knew what was happening in the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO). Despite these serious allegations, Pinarayi did not protest strongly or clarify.

Let me tell you another recent incident that illustrates Pinarayi’s politics and stand against BJP and Modi. Pinarayi was supposed to attend a meeting in Kolkata. It was a historic meeting for CPM, intended to lay the foundation stone for a memorial for Jyoti Basu. Nitish Kumar was to inaugurate the function, and Pinarayi was a key speaker. However, Nitish Kumar did not attend the meeting, and a week later, he joined the NDA. As the only CPM chief minister, Pinarayi had an obligation to attend the function. He did not attend the function in Kolkata, which was decided months earlier, and instead chose to receive the Prime Minister in Kochi. According to my sources, Minister Rajeeve was supposed to receive Modi as per protocol, but instead, Pinarayi came down to meet him. A photo was released the next day showing him shaking hands with Modi, with the governor standing beside them in a peevish mood. On probing, I came to understand that the photo was taken by a PRD photographer from Thiruvananthapuram and released by the CMO.

1ee6fnt,IndianLeft,general elections 2024,"Coaching centre in Delhi flooded, resulting in three confirmed deaths as of yet","https://reddit.com/link/1ee6fnt/video/x7mlg2rv39fd1/player



A tragic incident happened on July 27, 2024 when three students died and one other was missing after the basement of a building housing a popular civil service coaching centre, Rau's IAS , was flooded following heavy rain in central Delhi’s Old Rajinder Nagar area.

The total number of deaths, however, is likely to be much higher as the waterlogged test center is big, and the police and administration are withholding information and are not responding to any queries about what is happening inside. Such incidents of water logging are a recurring problem in this area and several complaints were made only a few days ago to resolve this issue. Two days ago, a 26 year old student in Patel Nagar was electrocuted to death due to negligence of the government. The situation in ORN too is made worse by this horrific possibility of electric shock in the building where the students are trapped. The police, it must be noted, are discretely moving dead bodies away from the hundreds of furious students who are currently holding a sit-in for justice.

The rains have exposed and worsened the pathetic condition of public infrastructure in Delhi. From every direction, news comes of schools leaking, open and overflowing sewage drains and waterlogging.

The responsibility of these horrific murders of innocent students lies with the central government, the sitting MP of the BJP, the Delhi government, sitting MLAs, MCD, and coaching mafias who are all playing with the lives of students.

Protests are ongoing.

1e2s46z,IndianLeft,election results,What is Lesser Evilism and How to Defeat It,"Lesser evilism(LE) is typically used to refer to advocating supporting a less despicable party to prevent an worse, often far-right party from getting power. 

# Why Is it Bad?

Lesser evilism leads to maintaining capitalist status quo while giving lip service to democracy.

A common argument given by lesser-evilists(LEs) is that the outcome of an election would be even worse if people do not vote for the lesser evil. This by itself is true, but the problem lies in not recognizing that voting should only be a temporary bulwark against fascism and that it should not be the place where politics begins and ends. It is completely understandable is say a person fully advocates and radicalizes people for anti-capitalism for four years and spends 20 minutes on election day to vote for the lesser evil *(and I don't regard this category to be LE for the purpose of this post).*

**But LEs don't.** They spend all of their time defending the lesser evil capitalist party throughout and continue to support it before, during and after elections, completely ignoring the needs to working classes(local and global) and contributing to maintaining capitalism.

*Where is the ""evil"" in their ""lesser-evilism""?* They might as well believe that their favorite parties are not ""lesser-evil"", but are genuinely good and the end result would the same - deceiving the working classes.

# Understanding Lesser Evilism

The fact is many LEs don't really believe that their parties are the lesser evil in the dictionary definition of evil. How do you know? It is simple. Every time an LE claims that Biden is the lesser evil, tell them lesser evil is.. still evil and that still makes Biden an evil man(use this exact wording). I have seen many supposed LEs get weirdly uncomfortable with this obvious inference and experience cognitive dissonance.

Why is this so? **Because in their heads, lesser evil means ""imperfect"".** Not malice, but imperfection is what comes to their mind. They believe that ""lesser evil"" politics are oopsies by well-meaning individuals. But then why do they still admit that these parties are the lesser evil? To save face in front of leftist and other fellow citizens who are not aboard their platform and to manipulate them as their favorite parties commit atrocity after another towards the working classes and allying with capitalists.

This is not to say that your partner, parent or a relative is an evil manipulative person at heart. They are more likely to be LEs because they themselves have been subject to manipulation by MSM and fellow LEs. Lesser evilism is a contagious disease.

# How to Counter It

Radicalise them by showing the evils of capitalism and more importantly teach them that democracy is not just voting, that they in addition to voting lesser evil, they should actually be criticising those parties and support labor movements and parties wherever possible. Most LEs already understand that corporations really don't have the people's best interests in mind, but they suffer from believing that politics begins and ends at elections. That needs to addressed.",18,0.92,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianLeft/comments/1e2s46z/what_is_lesser_evilism_and_how_to_defeat_it/,Big-Victory-3180,2024-07-14 03:05:31

1e2zvlg,IndianLeft,INDIA alliance,Class Struggle,"There is a tendency among liberals and non-Marxist socialists to think of class struggle in Marxism as separate from other conflicts we see in society. Struggle of oppressed nationalities, of women against patriarchy or Dalits against caste in this view are separate from the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeois. This leads one to a very economistic view of Marxism that Marx, Engles and later Marxists would definitely reject. 

For example, Ambedkar referred to Marxism as a theory aiming for “equalization of property” and that which talked about the conflict between only workers and capitalists and  has nothing to do with caste.

Since this view is very common, I would like to comment on how class struggle and many other social conflicts are connected and shed some light on what Class Struggle really meant for Marx and Engles. I will use insights from Dominico Losurdo’s book Class Struggle.

**1.**       **Emancipatory foreign policy**

For both Marx and Engles an emancipatory foreign policy was essential part of the class struggle. In Wage Labor and Capital, Marx referred to the starvation of Ireland and many global events as part of the general class struggle between the working class and the bourgeois. Both Marx’s and Engles’ families were highly invested in Irish independence struggle and advocated for Polish independence.    

They did not see this struggle as separate from the struggle of the proletarian against the bourgeoisie as Marx even went as far as to compare the exploitation of one nation by another to the exploitation of one man by another. 

Marx and Engles saw conflicts of oppressed nations against imperialism as part of the broader struggle against Capitalism. This also applies to the imperialism of current times. For example, Palestine, although it is fighting the barbarity of Israeli settler colonialism, the settler colonial power itself is a product of American Imperial project in the middle east.  

Losurdo draws our attention to two quotes from The Communist Manifesto.

*History of all hitherto existing society is history of class struggles.*

*The history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs.* 

The plural “struggles”, “antagonisms”, and “ forms” signal that class struggle doesn’t always manifests as conflict between worker and bourgeoise. It does not refer to a repetition of identical, continual recurrence of the same class struggles in the same form.

It refers to the multiplicity of shapes and forms that class struggle can assume.

 

**2.       Genus and the Species**  

Marx and Engles were not the first to discover the existence of social classes. They did discover that class society is but a phase in the development of society. This phase began with the subjugation and domestication of women and overthrow of The Mother Right as said my Engles. Thus, for Marx “Women’s emancipation is the natural measure of the general emancipation”.

In early class society the means of production was not just land but also people – slaves. All civilizations practiced some form of slavery at some point in their history. In these slave societies one could be owned, bought, sold and used by their master like an object. The collection of slaves a man had which included his wife and children was called “famalia” in Latin and is the ancestor word of English “family”. Even in many Indian languages the word for husband and wife are words that also mean owner and owned. These are cultural relics of an earlier mode of production and explain the existing cultural practices and social divisions of labor.

This is another species of class struggle according to Losurdo.

According to Losurdo the ‘genus’ – class struggle in general is a family of all those social forces that are resisting/ enforcing the dominant division of labor and ownership of means of production that holds together the dominant social order. The ‘species’ are the specific forms those social forces assume in concrete circumstances. These specific forms can be farmers protests, feminist movements, Adivasi resistance etc. or state repression against them.

Marxism thus, is a general theory of social conflicts. It takes account of the multiplicity of forms in which social conflicts manifests itself.

Of course, individuals can develop conflicts with each other for different reasons but as Losurdo says “Marxism tries to analyze the social subject who directly or indirectly, pertain to the social order, to some essential articulation of the division of labor and social order”.  

 

**3.       Struggle for recognition.**

In Principles of Communism Engles writes:

*The slave is sold once and for all—the proletarian must sell himself hourly and daily. The slave is the property of his master and no matter how miserable his existence may be, it is securely guaranteed by the interests of this master. The individual proletarian, the property of the whole bourgeois class, so to speak, whose labor is bought only when needed, has no such secure existence. This existence is secure only for the working class as a whole.*

*The slave is a chattel and not a member of society while the proletarian—as a person—is recognized as a member of society. The slave may therefore have a better existence than the proletarian, yet the proletarian is part of a higher stage of social development and stands higher than the slave.*

The emphasis is on the ‘proletariat’ is ‘recognized as a person’.

This higher recognition as a fuller human being gives the proletariat the right to join trade unions, political parties, gives him higher dignity, the right participate in civil society, etc. In the quote Engles highlights the politico-moral side of the class struggle.

This applies to India as well. The rights that are slowly being diluted by BJP were fought for by the broad masses. These rights even under bourgeois rule were gained only after the independence when decolonization was the primary goal for which a broad alliance of masses cutting across caste lines, gender lines, linguistic lines etc. needed to be mobilized.

Of course, this Politico-Moral battle does not end with Capitalism as Capitalism and prevailing casteism, patriarchy in society still maintains oppressive dehumanizing structures which alienate the subject. Lenin’s spoke of economism as that which limits workers aspirations to better economic conditions (trade union consciousness) and tries to restrict any aspiration of establishing proletarian rule (class political consciousness). Economism is the hallmarks of Fabian varieties of socialism like that of Dr. Ambedkar and it was one of the main reasons why Ambedkar opposed communism.

Economism can be very dangerous as it can lead to one section of the working class being over exploited for the economic benefit of another. This can manifest as upper-class workers depriving lower class workers from education so their supply of cheap households helps remains intact and there is less competition for jobs. It is called trade union consciousness as more organized and privileged workers can negotiate economic benefits for themselves with the ruling class at the detriment of less privileged workers. This is why it is essential to eliminate economism and nurture class solidarity across caste lines

Conclusion

There was someone, a contemporary of Marx who did separate the workers struggle against bourgeois from all other revolutionary struggle and that was Proudhon. The father of anarchism urged workers not to be bothered with oppressed foreign nations or feminist movements. But since Marxism is dialectical and dialectics is about change, it is capable of taking account of the varied forms of contradictions that lead to change.",25,0.97,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianLeft/comments/1e2zvlg/class_struggle/,Native_ov_Earth,2024-07-14 11:17:11

1ajvx05,IndianLeft,MK Stalin,Frustrated rant with leftist academics,"This is a rant against academics who have found their voice only in the most obvious and physical instances of violence such as the Palestinian genocide. But everything else for them is a conspiracy because there's no neat archival material that points to it. 
You know dominoes right? A long and sometimes intricate chain of blocks stacked in a way that you only need to make the very first one fall, one that might be far, far away from the last, with a surity that the last one will indeed fall. Yeah, academics only consider it a genocide at the last domino, or maybe the last 5, if they're critical.

The trouble with academics is the assertive blindness to events which do not come to them with a nice bow that says, yes this is the truth I'm fact. 
1. Let's look at the Palestinian genocide since most people here would agree, that is in indeed happening. 
2. A few years from now, all the academics sitting in the nice Ivy League institutes publish about 100 papers on how ""there are two sides to the story"" and the dialectics of Palestinian genocide. 
3. We know that no real critical  nice will come out of these because they will be shut down faster than Gay was fired as the Harvard President and faster than Columbia removed any posts alluding to attack by IDF Soldies on its own NY campus on the students. 
4. So whatever critique of Israel comes out of there, is a nice sanctioned version. 
5. Slowly archives will be fabricated through the intricate chain of ""journalists"" and writers like the guy who wrote black book of Communism and said that Stalin killed a gazillion people and then said haha, no I was making it up. But who cares? 
6. Academics will publish peer on peer reviewed papers of all these asshole peers and there you have created history. 
7. In about a 100 years, you can turn a whole generation. Remember Freud's uncle, Edward Bernays, the father of American marketing. In his 1928 book, ""Propaganda,"" Bernays hypothesized that by understanding the group mind, it would be possible to manipulate people's behavior without their even realizing it. To test this hypothesis, Bernays launched one of his most famous public relations campaigns: convincing women to smoke. And don't we see that as a mark of feminism everywhere. Yeah, so cool. 

8. Also It's like here - the Gujarat board's exam question ""How did Gandhi commit suicide?"" It's laughable now, but if you were to tell your great grandchildren Gandhi was assassinated,  they'd thing Dadi is a conspiracy theorist.

So what are some examples? Well all genocidal tactics  I've studied have started against Black people. Particularly as South Asians, somehow racist crimes don't boil our blood ad much as nearby ones like Palestine and Kashmir. So by the time they happen there's been so much warning but we think it's a new kind of violence. I don't blame us - we're also a country where the work culture and inequality is intentionally kept bad so that there is literally no mental surplus to think critically about anything. Students are fed whatever opioid American media is making now days and by the time they come into the work force there's no time to revise. 

Look at MK ultra, specifically meant to experiment on Black men with LSD. This is not a theory,  it's a declassified doc. 

Look at the known fact that bioweapoms were developed to give Chavez cancer. 

There's so so much more - 
Freemasons, 
Bildenberg, 
weather modifications are all real and documented and should come as no surprise but it's embarrassing to talk about it because we don't want to be coo coo, and the reason it's coo coo because the West decides its coo coo and has enough TV shows and podcasts where only coo coo people say these things. 

The crazy thing is ,these are documented, but we ARE SO AFRAID TO IMAGINE THE UNDOCUMENTED HISTORY. How do we know Renaissance is real and not just a Propaganda to validate European ""superiority ""? Why do we think money is a universal system?

1d4ah8g,IndianLeft,development politics India,A brief note on how the electoral CPI(M) betrayed the indian revolutionary cause.,"
The CPI (marxist) a political party in india currently in power in the state of Kerala betrayed the cause of indian communism by siding with reactionaries.

Many people on the left including non-indian leftists seem to have a soft spot for the CPI(M) , many seem to think of them as the last bastion of the left in India. They praise the high literacy rates and the higher life expectancy , but what they are uanble see is the reactionary nature of the party and the atrocities they have committed.

For some context :
India is a semi feudal country under the grip of neo-imperialism by the imperial core. One system of opression that still persists in India is caste oppression which is based in the ownership of land. The untouchable castes (dalits) disproportionately make up the landless peasants population, while the oppressor castes generally own disproportionate amount of land, there are also middle castes who own some land but not a lot, calculations[1] by scholars Nitin Tagade and Sukhadeo Thorat, based on the All-India Debt and Investment Survey, show that members of the Scheduled Castes, who account for 18% of the country’s households, own only 8.5% of the land in India. On the other hand, upper-caste Hindus, who make up 22% of the households, own 28% of the land, Caste isnt just confined to the rural parts of india, but also the urban parts although it’s orgins are in ownership of land, people are frequently not hired and not allowed to rent homes because of their caste in urban india too.

What has kerela done to address this system of oprression? Perhaps they have redistributed land ? Maybe collectivized agricultre? They did redistribute land but only above a certain land ceiling , big landlords still remained. Infact huge swathes of dalits and indigenous people in kerela are still landless. Among the landless population, indigenous people are overepresented. You the reader might ask what offical data we have , we do have date but not on a large scale ,why? Because the “communist” goverment refuses to do a caste census! It refuses to reveal how much wealth which castes have, because that would reveal the monopoly of certain castes economically. Triple exclusion of dalits in Land Ownership in kerela[2], a study published in the journal Social Change, shows that low rate of land ownership by them is the result of a exclusionsary policy by the goverment! Does this sound like something a communist goverment would do?

This isn’t all. The goverment has also been involved in massacares of dalits. 
The Marichjhapi massacre, when dalit refugees from bangladesh came to indian they settled in Marichjapi. Schools and hospitals were built and many were involved in pisciculture.
A press blackout followed and survivors today say[3], huts were burned, woman were raped, wells poisoned. The survivors of the massacare still to this day have not gotten any Justice.

These are not the actions of a communist party but a reactionary one doused in red paint and communist aesthetics.
Even today, the first dalit leader in the politburo of the party was only admitted in 2022, 58 years after it’s creation, how utterly shameful.

I hope by this article I am able to convince you, the reader ,why as leftists we shouldn’t support the CPI(M).

1dzpxkt,IndianLeft,development politics India,Hope for India? The Experiences of an Indian-Born American NRI,"Greetings.

I am an NRI. I was born in India but I moved to the US thanks to my fathers' hard work and I had the privilege to study and grow up in the US. I would come back to India during summer vacation.

I had the chance to meet a diverse range of people and perspectives and also as a result I became slowly leftist and more aware of the social issues plaguing the world and the US.

I have come back to India for study college after finishing school in the US. Because now I have a better social perspective, I am aware of all the problems in India and Indian society.

Failure of infrastructure, dirty public spaces, ""It's not my problem"" mindset, religious, political division, racism, casteism, colorism, climate change, proletariat struggle, and poverty are some that I have noticed.

When I was in the US, my fellow classmates were mostly open and were class conscious; They were going to protests and advocating for change.

Here, I don't see such a movement among the youth (or I may not be conscious of such a movement). I see people caring about their own success, chasing after money, jobs, placement, exams, etc. People look at me weird for being polite or holding onto trash instead of throwing it out onto the street.

Among NRIs, almost 90% I have met see India as a burden; A place they go to to visit their grandparents or take care of unfinished business. These people, often skilled workers, want a better future for their children (which is totally acceptable), so they leave. They maintain cultural and sometimes pollitical ties back home but they seem to develop a romanticized view of India and their hometown, forgetting about the problems until they come back and visit. But it pains me to see the state of India right now. There is a brain drain apparently going on.

Is there a national unity among the youth in India? Is class consciousness developing? Will India and her people ever become better in the near future? Mass cultural reformation?

I have privelage being an NRI but at the same time as a leftist, I want to bring change, educate, and help. Thinking about all this just makes me sad. I want to help but at the same time I don't want to throw away opportunities by staying here.

I still have 4 years of college to finish before I have to decide whether to stay or to go. I also have super religious hindu parents who are worried I am going this way and that I'm trying to gain autonomy. Till then, I just feel so disconnected. I'm going to try reconnecting with my roots and exploring India.

Any thoughts on my experience, comrades?",18,0.85,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianLeft/comments/1dzpxkt/hope_for_india_the_experiences_of_an_indianborn/,Due-Freedom-4321,2024-07-10 07:40:51

1det75w,IndianLeft,development politics India,"Unless, as Lenin could do in Russia, the left imagines the proletariat in both their specific forms of poverties and their powers","Link is posted in comment after this

In India the party left, and whatever is left of it, deliberately refused to understand something fundamental: The racial social order of caste is the regular form of all divisions of labour in the subcontinent. The upper caste leaders of the communist parties organizing and leading the lower caste labourers to their infinitely deferred liberation is the very repetition of the caste order. Unless, as Lenin could do in Russia, the left imagines the proletariat in both their specific forms of poverties and their powers while gathering in the singular human experience of belonging to the community of the forsaken, any leftist politics will be a minor disaster within the crises which are upon us.

If politics is to be the fight for freedom then it must be capable of the seizing of the conditions of action, which are more and more global today. If anyone gives you the pill of regional autonomy they are trying to sedate you and confine you to a region determined by a developing techno-economic world order. Instead, we must begin to recognize this: national forms of politics are the locus of the real crisis, and democracy can now be secured only through the assertion that the world belongs to all. A left worthy of its name today shall have the courage to refuse the regional power deals from snake oil salesmen of anti-politics, who roam India in the garb of subaltern and postcolonial historians. Such a left will have the courage to imagine collectively and arrive at bauplan of a world democracy. It will have the courage to be infinitely open in order to gather the people of the world as the people of the world. The only thing left then is ana-stasis.",25,0.93,1,https://i.redd.it/h342g0d5ka6d1.jpeg,SubstantialAd1027,2024-06-13 07:28:16

1dk3w66,IndianLeft,development politics India,Intellectual Insurgency and Mahesh Raut  by Divya Dwivedi and Shaj Mohan,"Quotes from article

[We are witnessing a pretend politics which lives on the time borrowed from a deferred revolution.](https://m.thewire.in/article/rights/mahesh-raut-elgar-parishad-book-excerpt)

BJP and most other political parties including the Congress have continued their relation to the Adivasi people through the ancient denigrate-dominate function. They have never encouraged critical, theoretical and jurisprudential discussions on the relation between the modern constitution of India and the rights of the Adivasi people. If one cares to look, there is extraordinary suffering, state sponsored or directed oppression, and exploitation taking place in the Adivasi lands distributed across India. Through all institutions which they control, the upper castes maintain the denigrate-dominate function.

The word “insurgency” is often used to refer to the refusal by people to obey orders and to recognise authority. For example, the call for a “total revolution” by Jaya Prakash Narayan in the 1970s which was heeded by the RSS was in effect a political insurrection. It remained short of what Marx, in The Poverty of Philosophy, called “total revolution” – “a struggle of class against class, a struggle which carried to its highest expression”.
